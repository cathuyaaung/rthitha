 By the way, he introduced me as John but everyone calls me Jack.

74
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:42,349
 Oh, fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

75
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,548
 He got me right, though. l'm just Judy.

76

 Great, Just Judy!

77
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,933
 - No surprises? - No surprises.

 - Not like the stag night? - Unlike the stag night.

79
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:02,231
 - You admit the prostitutes were a mistake? - l do.

80
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:05,817
 And it would've been much better if they'd not turned out to be men?

81
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,944
 That is true.

82
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,448
 Good luck, kiddo.

 Would you like to meet your household staff?

92
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:09,833
 Yes, l would like that very much indeed.

93
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:13,388
 Anything to put off actually running the country.

94

 - This is Terence. He's in charge. - Morning, sir.

 Oh, right. l should be easier than the last lot.

100
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:35,064
 No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.

101
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:37,983
 And this is Natalie. She's new, like you.

102
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:41,778
 - Hello, Natalie. - Hello, David. l mean, sir.

103
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,155
 Shit, l can't believe l've just said that.

104
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,950
 And now l've gone and said ''shit''. Twice. l'm so sorry, sir.

105
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:51,422
 You could've said ''fuck'' and we'd have been in real trouble.

106
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,290
 Thank you, sir. l had a premonition l was gonna fuck up on my first day.

107
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,971
 Oh, piss it!

108
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:04,809
 Right, l'll get my things and then let's fix the country, shall we?

109
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,758
 Yeah, l can't see why not.

110
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,408
 - lt's all right. - Did you see what l did?

111
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,524
 - Yes, l did. - l just went ''blurh''.

112
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,901

 Oh, no.

117
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,049
 That is so inconvenient.

118
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:45,929
 ln the presence of God, Peter and Juliet have given their consent

119
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:50,631
 and made their marriage vows to each other.

120
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:53,800
 They've declared their marriage by the giving of rings.

121
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:57,929
 l therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.

 Oh, l just popped over to borrow some old CDs.

00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:42,783
 - Lovely, obliging girl. - Yeah.

145
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:46,161
 l thought l'd pop back and see if she's better. This is good.

 - Oh. - Listen, erm, l've been thinking.

147
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:55,086
 l think we ought to take Mum out for her birthday on Friday. What do you think?

148
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:59,788
 - l just feel we've been bad sons this year. - Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.

00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:04,095
 - What do you do, Nancy? - l'm a cook.

162
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,107
 - Ever do weddings? - Yes, l do.

163
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,017
 - They should've asked you to do this one. - They did.

164
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,603
 - God, l wish you hadn't have turned it down. - l didn't.

165
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,897
 (Embarrassed giggle) Right.

166
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:21,902
 - l've worked out why l can't find true love. - Why is that?

167
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:24,446
 English girls. They're stuck up, you see.

168
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:29,294
 And l am primarily attractive to girls who are cooler, game for a laugh.

169
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:33,632
 Like American girls. So l should just go to America!

170
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:36,791
 l'd get a girlfriend there instantly. What do you think?

171
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,126
 l think it's crap, Colin.

172
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:41,003
 That's where you're wrong.

173
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:44,089
 American girls would dig me with my cute British accent.

174
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:48,301
 - You don't have a cute British accent. - Yes, l do! l'm going to America.

175
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:51,856
 Colin, you're a lonely, ugly arsehole. Accept it.

176
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:56,892
 Never. l am Colin, God of Sex. l'm just on the wrong continent, that's all.

177
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:59,780
 Bit of quiet while we finish the lighting, guys!

178
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:04,534
 - The traffic today was just... - Unbelievable.

179
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:07,026
 Judy, could you take the top off this time?

180
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,321
 Lighting need to know when we're gonna see the, erm, nipples and when we're not.

181
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:14,991
 Yes, OK. Right. At least it's nice and warm in here.

182
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,503
 Not always the case, is it?

183
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:20,329
 l was standing in for Brad Pitt once on Seven Years ln Tibet...

184
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,623
 - Yes, yeah. - Bloody freezing...

185
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:25,709
 Guys, time's tight and we have to get the actors in.

186
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,920
 - Fine. - l promise l won't look.

187
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,932
 (Judy laughs)

188
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:34,842
 (Director) Right, let's have another look at that, please.

189
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,271
 Can you just put your hands on her breasts?

190
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:50,648
 - OK, yeah. ls that all right? - Yes.

191
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,525
 l'll warm them up!

192
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:58,207
 - And massage them, please. - Right.

193
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:08,706
 lt's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it? Total gridlock this morning.

194
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:17,672
 Jo and l had a lot of time to prepare for this moment.

195
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:20,133
 Some of her requests,

196
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:25,940
 for instance, that l should bring Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral,

197
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:29,850
 l was confident she expected me to ignore.

198
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:33,071
 But others she was pretty damn clear about.

199
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:37,659
 When she first mentioned what's about to happen,

200
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:41,360
 l said, ''Over my dead body.''

201
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:44,582
 And she said, ''No, Daniel, over mine.''

202
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:47,793
 And as usual, my darling girl...

203
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,828
 and Sam's darling mum was right.

204
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:58,167
 So she's going to say her final farewell to you not through me but,

205
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,294
 inevitably,

206
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,630
 ever so coolly,

207
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:08,301
 through the immortal genius of the Bay City Rollers.

 Er, er, what?

225
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:15,444
 No, l-l just thought l'd ask bluntly in case it was the right question

226
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:20,407
 and you needed someone to talk to about it and no one had ever asked you.

227
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,286
 No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.

 This DJ, what do you reckon?

234
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,103
 - The worst in history? - Probably.

235
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,595
 l think it all hangs on the next song.

236
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,690
 Now here's one for the lovers.

237

 Oh, yes, of course, erm...

 Great, er, good, good.

 How are you doing, Mia? Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

247
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:24,213
 Absolutely.

248
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:28,342
 - Harry? - Sarah,

249
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:35,526
 switch off your phone and tell me exactly how long it is that you've been working here.

250
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:41,229
 Two years, seven months,

 three days and, l suppose, what, two hours?

252
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:49,069
 And how long have you been in love with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

253
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:52,197
 Um...

254
00:18:55,126 --> 00:19:00,120
 Two years, seven months, three days and, l suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.

255
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,882
 Thought as much.

256
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:03,999
 - Do you think everybody knows? - Yes.

 - Do you think Karl knows? - Yes.

258
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:10,432
 Oh, that is... that is bad news.

259
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:15,926
 l just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it.

260
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:19,471
 - Like what? - lnvite him out for a drink

261
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:24,402
 then casually mention you'd like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies.

262
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,811
 - You know that? - Yes.

263
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:30,314
 And so does Karl.

264

 Yes, is that an important message to you, Bill?

 (Snorts) Not really, Mike.

285
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:51,219
 Christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives.

 wasn't some smug teenager

301
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:43,224

 of the moment we try to squeeze an extra syllable into the fourth line.

311

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,314
 ls the new prime minister in trouble already?

318
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,496
 ~ l feel it in my fingers l feel it in my toes ~

319
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:46,124
 - OK. What's next? - The President's visit.

320
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:50,294
 Ah, yes, yes. l fear this is going to be a difficult one to play. Alex.

321
00:22:51,378 --> 00:22:55,705
 There's a strong feeling in the party we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied

322
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:58,291
 - like the last government. - (All) Here, here.

323
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:02,472
 This is our first really important test, let's take a stand.

324
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:07,226
 Right. Right. l understand that but l have decided...

325
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,844
 not to. Not this time.

326
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:15,442
 Let's not forget that America is the most powerful country in the world.

327
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:18,017
 l'm not going to act like a petulant child.

328
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:23,855
 Who do you have to screw round here to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

329
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,624
 Right.

330
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:34,406
 (Knocking)

331
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,617
 Yeah, come in.

332
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,508
 - These are from the Treasury... - Uh-huh.

333
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,667
 ..and these are for you.

334
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,513
 Excellent. Thanks a lot.

335
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:52,766
 l was hoping you'd win, not that l wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke,

336
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,718
 just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate.

337
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,678
 Thanks very much. Thanks...

338
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,473
 Natalie.

339
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:11,773
 God, come on, get a grip. You're the Prime Minister, for God's sake.

340
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,360
 So what do you reckon to our new prime minister?

341
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,990
 Oh, l like him. l can't understand why he's not married, though.

342
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,211
 You know the type, he's married to his job.

343
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:27,506
 Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

344
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:30,832
 Excuse me, Judy, if you could just lower the nipples

345
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:33,376
 - and cheat them a bit to the left? - OK.

346
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,256
 l have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure,

347
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:43,009
 it's lovely to find someone l can actually chat to.

348
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,136
 - Thank you! - Oh, well, you know.

349
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:46,929
 - And ditto. - Thank you.

350
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:49,348
 The move again, please, Judy.

351
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,934
 - Ooh, sorry. - Oh, God, sorry. You all right?

352
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,116
 - Exciting news! - What?

353
00:24:58,158 --> 00:25:01,494
 l've bought a ticket to the States. l'm off in three weeks.

354
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:02,996
 - No. - Yes!

355
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:07,197
 - To a fantastic place called Wisconsin. - No!

356
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:10,909
 Yes! Wisconsin babes, here comes Sir Colin!

357
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:15,173
 No, Col! There are a few babes in America, l grant you,

358
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:17,999
 but they're going out with rich, attractive guys.

359
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:21,304
 Tone, you're just jealous.

360
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:25,255
 You know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in America

361
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:29,717
 contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me

362
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,430
 - than the whole of the United Kingdom. - That is total bollocks. You're mad.

363
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:39,434
 No, l'm wise. Stateside l am Prince William without the weird family.

364
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,770
 - No, Colin, no! - Yes!

365
00:25:41,822 --> 00:25:43,021
 - Nyet! - Da!

366
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:44,449
 - Nein! - Ja, darling!

367
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:48,234
 Right, the Christmas party, not my favourite night of the year

368
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:50,653
 and your unhappy job to organise.

369
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:53,708
 - Tell me. - lt's basic, really.

370
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:57,576
 Find a venue, over-order on the drinks, bulk buy the guacamole

371
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:01,673
 and advise the girls to avoid Kevin if they want their breasts unfondled.

372
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:06,208
 - Wives and family and stuff? - Yeah. l mean, not children.

373
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,878
 But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera.

374
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:15,685
 Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

375
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:20,523
 No. l'll just be hanging around the mistletoe, hoping to be kissed.

376
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:24,610
 Really?

377
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:26,727
 Right.

378
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,947
 He now spends all the time in his room. l mean, he'll be up there now.

379
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,700
 - That's not unusual. My horrid son... - Bernard?

380
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:48,298
 Bernard. Stays in his room all the time. Thank goodness.

381
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,175
 Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time.

382
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:56,795
 l'm afraid that there's something really wrong, you know?

383
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,922
 l mean, clearly it's about his mum

384
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:04,135
 but Christ, he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all l know.

385
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:05,980
 (Karen) At the age of 1 1?

386
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:10,265
 (Daniel) Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then. Maybe just his veins.

387
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:14,696
 The problem is his mum always used to talk to him, you know, and...

388
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:21,744
 l don't know, this whole stepfather thing seems suddenly to somehow matter

389
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:24,069
 like it never did before.

390
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:28,949
 Listen, it was always going to be a totally shit time.

391
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:31,576
 Just be patient.

392
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:33,995
 And maybe check the room for needles.

393
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:39,041
 And then when he sometimes does come out, it's obvious he's been crying.

394
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:51,761
 lt's just such a ridiculous waste.

395
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:55,066
 And now if it's going to ruin Sam's life as well...

396
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:59,226
 l just don't know.

397
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,978
 Get a grip.

398
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,240
 People hate sissies.

399
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,566
 No one's ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time.

400
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:10,569
 Yeah. Absolutely.

401
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,696
 Helpful.

402
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,248
 So, what's the problem, Samuel?

403
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:30,962
 ls it just Mum or is it something else, huh?

404
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,507
 Maybe school?

405
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:37,645
 Are you being bullied?

406
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,940
 Or is it something worse?

407
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:45,058
 Can you give me any clues at all?

408
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:49,864
 - You really want to know? - l really want to know.

409
00:28:49,906 --> 00:28:52,481
 Even though you won't be able to help?

410
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,150
 Even if that's the case, yeah.

411
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:59,613
 OK. Well...

412
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,575
 truth is, actually...

413
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:06,536
 l'm in love.

414
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:08,214
 Sorry?

415
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:12,833
 l know l should be thinking about Mum and l am but l'm in love.

416
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:17,180
 l was before she died and there's nothing l can do about it.

417
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:21,299
 - Aren't you a bit young to be in love? - No.

418
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:24,385
 Ah, well. OK, well...

419
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,764
 l'm a little relieved.

420
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:32,017
 - Why? - Because l...

421
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:34,227
 thought it'd be something worse.

422
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:37,313
 Worse than the total agony of being in love?

423
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:40,034
 Er...

424
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:42,776
 No, you're right.

425
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:44,986
 Total agony.

426
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,240
 - Night, Sarah. - Night, Karl.

427
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,777
 (Mobile)

428
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,199
 Yeah, absolutely.

429
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,535
 Free as a bird. Fire away.

430
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:13,190
 Alone again.

431
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,161
 Naturally.

432
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,361
 - l'll deal with it. - Mm.

433
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:23,043
 - Ah. Natalie. - Sir.

434
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:26,629
 Thanks.

435
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,746
 Natalie.

436
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,802
 Erm, l'm starting to feel...

437
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,713
 uncomfortable about us working so closely every day

438
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:43,342
 and me knowing so little about you, it seems elitist and wrong.

439
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,261
 Well, there's not much to know.

440
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:49,848
 Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?

441
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,110
 Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

442
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:55,519
 - Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth. - Oh.

443
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,356
 So which exactly is the dodgy end?

444
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:03,026
 At the end of the high street, Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.

445
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:05,945
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy. - Hm.

446
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:10,293
 Erm, and you live with your husband? Boyfriend?

447
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:14,547
 - Three illegitimate but charming children? - No.

448
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:19,249
 l've just split up with my boyfriend, so l'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

449
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:23,628
 - Ah. Sorry. - No, it's fine.

450
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,130
 l'm well shot of him.

451
00:32:26,182 --> 00:32:29,018
 - He said l was getting fat. - l beg your pardon?

452
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,011
 He said no one'd fancy a girl with thighs the size of tree trunks.

453
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:35,680
 Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.

454
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:39,100
 No.

455
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:48,327
 You know, erm...

456
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:52,289
 being Prime Minister, l could just have him murdered.

457
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,865
 Thank you, sir. l'll think about it.

458
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:59,868
 Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.

459
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,914
 Ruthless, trained killers are just a phone call away.

460
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:11,671
 Oh, God.

461
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:16,675
 Did you have this kind of problem?

462
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,721
 Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.

463
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:25,224
 So, let's go. We can definitely crack this.

464
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:27,518
 Remember, l was a kid once, too.

465
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,980
 So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?

466
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:33,940
 - Yeah. - Uh-huh. Good, good.

467
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:37,110
 And what does she, he, feel about you?

468
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:40,113
 SHE doesn't even know my name.

469
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:43,001
 And even if she did, she'd despise me.

470
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:45,409
 She's the coolest girl in school.

471
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:49,590
 And everyone worships her because she's heaven.

472
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,165
 Good. Good.

473
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:55,585
 Well,

474
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:58,337
 basically you're fucked, aren't you?

475
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:02,925
 (~ All l Want For Christmas ls You)

476
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:07,053
 Hi there and welcome back.

477
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:11,432
 So, three weeks till Christmas, looks like the real competition is gonna be Blue.

478
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:16,030
 l saw them on the show last week. They weren't very nice about my record.

479
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:18,480
 No. Little scamps.

480
00:34:18,532 --> 00:34:21,983
 But very, very talented musicians.

481
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:26,331
 Yeah. l understand you've got a prize for our competition winners.

482
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:27,863
 Yes, l have, Ant or Dec.

483
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:31,961
 lt's a personalised felt-tip pen.

484
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,660
 Oh, great.

485
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:37,497
 lt's brilliant. lt even writes on glass,

486
00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:42,345
 so if you've got a framed picture, like, for instance, this one of Blue,

487
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:44,462
 you can just write on it.

488
00:34:56,524 --> 00:34:58,151
 (Kids snickering)

489
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:02,102
 (Dec) Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy. (Billy) Oh, yeah.

490
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:05,022
 Hiya, kids.

491
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:08,493
 Here's an important message from your Uncle Bill -

492
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:10,693
 don't buy drugs.

493
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:15,750
 Become a pop star and they give you them for free.

494
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:20,619
 And l do believe it's a commercial break. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

495
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:25,498
 ~ All l want for Christmas is you ~

496
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:36,883
 - Look at him! Eurh! - Just a minute.

497
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,511
 Actually, they're not funny. They're art.

498
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,941
 (Laughing)

499
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:46,777
 OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place.

500
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:51,198
 Great. l've got Juliet on the other line, she wants to ask you a favour.

501
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,234
 - (Sighing) OK, fine. - Thanks and, er, be nice.

502
00:35:56,286 --> 00:36:01,405
 - l'm always nice. - 'You know what l mean, Marky, be friendly.'

503
00:36:01,457 --> 00:36:03,824
 - l'm always... - (Juliet) 'Mark?'

504
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:06,827
 Hi. How was the honeymoon?

505
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:09,662
 lt was great. Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.

506
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:13,332
 - So, what can l do for you? - 'lt's only a tiny favour.'

507
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:16,387
 l've just tried the wedding video and it's a disaster.

508
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,515
 - 'lt's come out all blue and wibbly.' - l'm sorry.

509
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:23,258
 l remember you filming a lot and l wondered if l could look at it.

510
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,437
 To be honest, l didn't really...

511
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:30,191
 Please. All l want is one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

512
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:35,185
 l'll have a look but l'm pretty sure l wiped it, so don't get any hopes up.

513
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:38,104
 - 'Must go.' - (Click)

514
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:45,580
 Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

515
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:49,573
 No. l've done fuck-all and never will because he's too good for me.

516
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,700
 How true.

517
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,203
 - (Sarah) Stop. - (Mobile)

518
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,497
 And of course, your mobile goes.

519
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,177
 Hello. Hi. How you doing?

520
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,181
 - So, how's the Christmas party going? - Good.

521
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,433
 Think l've found a venue.

522
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:10,894
 - What's it like? - Good. Good.

523
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:16,055
 lt's an art gallery. Full of dark corners for doing dark deeds.

524
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,268
 Oh. Right.

525
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,532
 Good. Well, l suppose l should take a look at it or something.

526
00:37:25,574 --> 00:37:27,701
 You should.

527
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,532
 (Typewriter clacking)

528
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:40,410
 (Bell tinkles)

529
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:48,334
 Ah, bonjour, Eleonore.

530
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:51,253
 Bonjour, Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.

531
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,432
 And this year you bring a lady guest?

532
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:56,727
 No. There's a change of situation. Just me.

533
00:37:56,768 --> 00:38:01,231
 - Oh. Am l sad or not sad? - l think you're not surprised.

534
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:04,025
 - And you stay here till Christmas? - Yeah, yeah.

535
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:09,311
 Good. Well, l find you a perfect lady to clean the house.

536
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:11,938
 This is Aurelia.

537
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,950
 Ah.

538
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:18,068
 - Er, bonjour, Aurelia. - Bonjour.

539
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:23,281
 (French) Er, je suis, er, tres heureux de vous avoir ici.

540
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:28,421
 Unfortunately, she cannot speak French, just like you.

541
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:30,423
 She's Portuguese.

542
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:33,082
 (ltalian) Ah, ah, buongiorno.

543
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:35,094
 Eusebio, er, er...

544
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:37,544
 (Pidgin Spanish) Er, molto bueno...

545
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:43,841
 l think she's ten years too young to remember a footballer called Eusebio.

546
00:38:43,894 --> 00:38:46,302
 And ''molto bueno'' is Spanish.

547
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:47,897
 Right.

548
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,723
 Anyway, it's nice to meet you and...

549
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,517
 Can you drive her home after her work?

550
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:57,395
 Oh, absolutely, yes. Con-Con grande, er, pl-plesura.

551
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:59,689
 Which is what? Turkish?

552
00:39:07,415 --> 00:39:09,489
 (Pidgin Portuguese) Bello.

553
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,201
 Er, bella.

554
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:16,746
 Er, mon-montagno,

555
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:18,873
 arvarez...

556
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:24,378
 No, right. Silence is golden.

557
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,642
 As the Tremeloes said.

558
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:32,187
 Clever guys,

559
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:37,514
 although l think the original version was by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.

560
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,558
 Gr-great band.

561
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,143
 (~ High-pitched humming: Silence ls Golden)

562
00:39:42,195 --> 00:39:44,604
 Oh, shut up.

563
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:47,023
 (Cheering)

564
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,626
 (Press) Mr President!

565
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:02,130
 - Over here, sir! - What will you be talking about?

566
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:05,258
 Mr President, welcome.

567
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:06,926
 lt's a pleasure to meet you.

568
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:09,803
 Come through. l'm sorry your wife couldn't make it.

569
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:13,129
 So is she. Although she would have been kind of lonely.

570
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:15,256
 Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?

571
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:17,800
 Just never been able to tie a girl down.

572
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:20,521
 Not sure that politics and dating go together.

573
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:23,566
 Really? l've never found that.

574
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:28,070
 Yeah, you're still sickeningly handsome, whereas l look like my Aunt Mildred.

575
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:32,824
 - Very jealous of your plane, by the way. - Thank you. We love that thing.

576
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:35,149
 Ah, Natalie. Hi.

577
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:37,953
 Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far?

578
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,696
 - (Natalie giggles) - Excellent.

579
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:47,118
 (Sighs) My goodness, that's a pretty little son of a bitch.

580
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,245
 Did you see those pipes?

581
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:52,498
 Yeah, she's terrific. At her job.

582
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:57,262
 No, absolutely not. We cannot and will not consult on that either.

583
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:59,212
 That is unexpected.

584
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:01,756
 Well, it shouldn't be.

585
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:05,009
 The last administration made it perfectly clear.

586
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:07,928
 We're being consistent with their policies.

587
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,847
 With all respect, they were bad policies.

588
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,152
 Thanks, Alex. l don't think we're making progress here.

589
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:18,104
 Let's, erm... move on, shall we?

590
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:24,036
 Well, now, that was an interesting day.

591
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:29,666
 Sorry if our line was firm but there's no point in tiptoeing around today,

592
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:32,492
 then just disappointing you for four years.

593
00:41:32,544 --> 00:41:35,494
 l have plans and l plan to see them through.

594
00:41:35,546 --> 00:41:38,633
 Absolutely. There is one final thing to look at.

595
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:41,927
 lt's very close to my heart. Just give me a second.

596
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,586
 l'll give you anything you ask for.

597
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:47,755
 As long as it's not something l don't wanna give.

598
00:41:52,478 --> 00:41:54,188
 Hi.

599
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,305
 Pathetic.

600
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,503
 lt's great Scotch.

601
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:24,496
 l'll, erm... l'll be going, then.

602
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,291
 Er, Natalie,

603
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:33,296
 l hope to see much more of you as our countries work toward a better future.

604
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:35,840
 Thank you, sir.

605
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:54,075
 Er, yes, Peter.

606
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,400
 Mr President, has it been a good visit?

607
00:42:56,452 --> 00:43:00,038
 Very satisfactory indeed.

608
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,749
 We got what we came for

609
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:06,325
 and our special relationship is still very special.

610
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:08,911
 Prime Minister?

611
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:13,509
 l love that word ''relationship''. Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?

612
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,085
 l fear that this has become a bad relationship.

613
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:22,392
 A relationship based on the President taking what he wants

614
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:27,469
 and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to, erm...

615
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,182
 Britain.

616
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:36,394
 We may be a small country but we're a great one, too.

617
00:43:36,446 --> 00:43:39,699
 The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles,

618
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,993
 - Sean Connery, Harry Potter. - (Laughter)

619
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:46,038
 - David Beckham's right foot. - (Laughter)

620
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,780
 David Beckham's left foot, come to that.

621
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:52,877
 And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend.

622
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:56,172
 And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward,

623
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:59,956
 l will be prepared to be much stronger.

624
00:44:00,008 --> 00:44:03,293
 And the President should be prepared for that.

625
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:06,181
 (Press clamouring)

626
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:15,220
 Mr President!

627
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:20,600
 Joe.

628
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:23,894
 lt's your sister on line four.

629
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,816
 All right. Er, yes, l'm very busy and important, how can l help you?

630
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:32,027
 Have you gone completely insane?

631
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,822
 - You can't always be sensible. - 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'

632
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,657

 The trouble with being the Prime Minister's sister is it puts your life into perspective.

635
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:52,461
 What did my brother do today? He fought for his country.

 (Portuguese) This stuff better be good.

693
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,250
 lt's not worth it, this isn't bloody Shakespeare.

 (Portuguese) Sim. (English) Crime. Crime, murder.

711
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,780
 (Portuguese) Frightening? (Gasps)

712
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,950
 Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary.

713
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:11,464
 And, er, sometimes not. Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

714
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:23,131
 Mm.

715
00:50:25,018 --> 00:50:28,844

 Sure.

 Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:53,515
 Great.

746
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:56,570
 Doesn't mean we'll be able to find the video, though.

 l had a real search when you first called and couldn't find it so...

 you never talk to me.

766

 You always talk to Peter.

767
00:55:45,303 --> 00:55:47,514
 You don't like me.

768
00:55:48,723 --> 00:55:50,798
 l hope it's useful.

769
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,936
 Don't show it around too much.

770
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:57,179

01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:41,716

 ~ And l love you, l love you, l love you... ~

959
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:47,857
 You're beautiful.

962
01:11:11,128 --> 01:11:13,411
 l-l'd better answer that.

963
01:11:17,676 --> 01:11:20,876
 Hello. Hi. Hello, darling.

964
01:11:20,928 --> 01:11:23,931
 No, no, l'm not busy. No, fire away.

965
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:26,892
 Right.

966
01:11:26,934 --> 01:11:30,979
 Yes, l... l'm not quite sure it's gonna be possible

967
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:33,773
 to get the Pope on the phone tonight but...

968
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:40,446
 Yes. Yes, l'm sure he's very good at exorcism but...

969
01:11:43,907 --> 01:11:46,399
 Well, l'm sure...

970
01:11:46,451 --> 01:11:50,278
 Jon Bon Jovi is as well and l'll definitely look into it.

971
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,916
 OK? OK, l'll talk to you later.

972
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:56,033
 All right, bye-bye.

973
01:12:01,423 --> 01:12:05,333
 - Sorry about that. - No, it's fine.

974
01:12:05,385 --> 01:12:08,387
 lt's my brother, he's not well, he calls a lot.

975
01:12:10,347 --> 01:12:12,839
 - l'm sorry. - No, it's fine. lt's fine.

976
01:12:12,891 --> 01:12:16,259
 l mean, it's not really fine, it is what it is,

977
01:12:16,311 --> 01:12:19,971
 and there being no parents now and us being over here,

978
01:12:20,023 --> 01:12:25,444
 it's my job to keep an eye on him. Not my job, obviously, l'm glad to do it...

979
01:12:25,486 --> 01:12:30,313
 That's OK. Life is full of interruptions and complications.

980
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:34,484
 So...

981
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,454
 (Mobile)

982
01:12:51,426 --> 01:12:53,500
 Will it make him better?

983
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:56,680
 No.

984
01:12:56,722 --> 01:12:58,797
 Then maybe...

985
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:01,633
 don't answer.

986
01:13:09,108 --> 01:13:11,683
 Hey. How you doing?

987
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:15,405
 Right, right. Oh, no, please.

988
01:13:15,447 --> 01:13:18,731
 Oh, please, please don't, little darling.

989
01:13:18,783 --> 01:13:23,579
 Between the two of us we'll find the answer and it won't hurt any more.

990
01:13:23,621 --> 01:13:25,612
 No, no.

991
01:13:25,665 --> 01:13:27,739
 l'm-l'm not busy. l...

992
01:13:29,376 --> 01:13:32,713
 Of course, if you want me to come over l will. Mm-hm.

993
01:13:34,422 --> 01:13:36,299
 OK.

994
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:48,132
 That was a good night.

995
01:13:48,185 --> 01:13:50,885
 - Except l felt fat. - Don't be ridiculous.

996
01:13:50,937 --> 01:13:52,595
 lt's true.

997
01:13:52,647 --> 01:13:56,859
 Nowadays the only clothes l can get into were once owned by Pavarotti.

998
01:13:56,901 --> 01:13:59,820
 l always think Pavarotti dresses very well.

999
01:14:03,365 --> 01:14:05,440
 Mia's very pretty.

1000
01:14:07,327 --> 01:14:09,401
 ls she?

1001
01:14:10,788 --> 01:14:13,822
 You know she is, darling.

1002
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:16,084
 Be careful there.

1003
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:42,097
 Have you been watching stuff on TV?

1004
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:46,017
 Yeah.

1005
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:48,061
 - Every night. - Good.

1006
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:50,271
 And every day.

1007
01:14:57,204 --> 01:15:02,157
 - The nurses are trying to kill me. - Nobody's trying to kill you, babe.

1008
01:15:08,256 --> 01:15:10,331
 Thank you.

1009
01:15:13,052 --> 01:15:15,544
 Don't do that, my darling.

1010
01:15:17,848 --> 01:15:19,923
 Thank you.

1011
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,139
 Don't do that.

 (Dog barking in distance)

1013
01:16:01,804 --> 01:16:06,297
 Right. Back at three. Christmas shopping, never easy or pleasant.

1014
01:16:06,349 --> 01:16:09,269
 Are you gonna get me something?

1015
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,385
 Er...

1016
01:16:12,897 --> 01:16:14,972
 l don't know, l hadn't thought.

1017
01:16:15,024 --> 01:16:16,900
 Where's Sarah, by the way?

1018
01:16:16,942 --> 01:16:19,726
 She couldn't make it in. Family thing.

1019
01:16:19,778 --> 01:16:23,521
 There's a word for hangover l've never heard before.

1020
01:16:23,573 --> 01:16:27,733
 - See you later. - Yes. Looking forward to it.

1021
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:33,196
 A lot.

1022
01:16:45,259 --> 01:16:47,469
 Are you gonna give me something?

1023
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,223
 l thought l made it clear last night.

1024
01:16:51,264 --> 01:16:55,007
 When it comes to me, you can have everything.

1025
01:16:55,059 --> 01:16:58,563
 So, erm, what do you need?

1026
01:16:59,814 --> 01:17:03,859
 Something along the stationery line? Are you short of staplers?

1027
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:07,352
 No. l don't want something l need.

1028
01:17:07,404 --> 01:17:10,855
 l want something l want. Something pretty.

1029
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:13,941
 Right.

1030
01:17:15,036 --> 01:17:17,110
 Right.

1031
01:17:24,461 --> 01:17:28,204
 Sorry l'm late, l had to drop off Bernie at rehearsal.

1032
01:17:32,092 --> 01:17:34,761
 Right, listen, you keep yourself occupied

1034

 - Thank you. - Thank you.

1035
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:04,872
 Looking for anything in particular, sir?

1036
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:08,573
 Yes. That necklace there, how much is it?

1037
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:10,835
 lt's £270.

1038
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:16,298
 - Erm, all right. Er, l'll have it. - Lovely.

1039
01:18:19,301 --> 01:18:22,418
 Would you like it...giftwrapped?

1040
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:25,254
 - Yes, all right. - Lovely.

1041
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,592
 Let me just pop it in the box.

1042
01:18:32,271 --> 01:18:33,731
 There.

1043
01:18:33,772 --> 01:18:37,390
 - Look, could we be quite quick? - Certainly, sir.

1044
01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:40,309
 Ready in the flashiest of flashes.

1045
01:18:47,785 --> 01:18:49,443
 - There. - That's great.

1046
01:18:49,495 --> 01:18:52,331
 Not quite finished.

1047
01:18:55,834 --> 01:19:00,546
 - l don't need a bag, l'll put it in my pocket. - Oh, this isn't a bag, sir.

1048
01:19:00,588 --> 01:19:04,008
 - Really? - This is so much more than a bag.

1049
01:19:10,764 --> 01:19:12,807
 Ooh!

1050
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,603
 Could we be quite quick, please?

1051
01:19:29,655 --> 01:19:32,439
 Prontissimo.

1052
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:53,468
 - What's that? - A cinnamon stick, sir.

1053
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:57,044
 - Actually, l really can't wait. - You won't regret it, sir.

1054
01:19:57,097 --> 01:19:59,380
 Want to bet?

1055
01:19:59,432 --> 01:20:01,882
 'Tis but the work of a moment.

1056
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:07,637
 There we go. Almost finished.

1057
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:12,183
 Are you gonna dip it in yogurt? Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1058
01:20:12,235 --> 01:20:15,352
 No, sir, we're going to pop it in the Christmas box.

1059
01:20:15,405 --> 01:20:17,031
 l don't want a Christmas box.

1060
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:19,856
 - But you wanted it giftwrapped. - l did but...

1061
01:20:19,909 --> 01:20:21,702
 - The final flourish. - Can l pay?

1062
01:20:21,744 --> 01:20:24,496
 - All we need now... - Oh, God.

1063
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:26,748
 - ..is a sprig of holly. - No, no, no, no.

1064
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:28,833
 - No bloody holly. - But sir...

1065
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:31,575
 - Leave it. - Ooh!

1066
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:35,620
 - Loitering around the jewellery section? - No. l was just looking around.

1067
01:20:35,673 --> 01:20:38,342
 Don't worry. My expectations are not that high

 you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink, do you? l mean, nothing implied.

1114
01:23:25,532 --> 01:23:27,899
 You are on the road to disaster.

1115

 No, l am on shag highway, heading west.

1116

 Farewell, failure.

 - Take me to a bar. - What kind of bar?

1121
01:23:55,017 --> 01:23:58,437
 Just any bar. Just your average American bar.

1122

 Wait till Carol-Anne gets here. She's crazy about English guys.

1140
01:24:56,905 --> 01:24:59,063
 (Stacey) Uh-huh.

1141
01:25:02,118 --> 01:25:06,111
 - Hey, girls. - Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1142
01:25:06,164 --> 01:25:08,780
 He's from England.

1143
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:13,076
 Well, step aside, ladies. This one's on me.

1144
01:25:16,214 --> 01:25:18,789
 - Hey, gorgeous. - (Gentle growl)

1145
01:25:20,551 --> 01:25:22,678
 That is so funny!

1146
01:25:24,013 --> 01:25:26,379
 - What do you call that? - Er, bottle.

1147
01:25:26,432 --> 01:25:28,558
 (With English accent) ''Bottle.''

1148
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,675
 - What about this? - Er, straw.

1149
01:25:30,727 --> 01:25:32,604
 (Girls) ''Straw.''

1150
01:25:32,645 --> 01:25:34,637
 - What about this? - Table.

1151
01:25:35,898 --> 01:25:37,973
 - Table. The same. - Oh, it's the same.

1152
01:25:38,025 --> 01:25:41,445
 - Where are you staying? - l don't actually know.

1153
01:25:41,487 --> 01:25:44,323
 l'll just check into a motel like in the movies.

1154
01:25:44,364 --> 01:25:47,701
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that is so cute.

1155
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:52,486
 No, no, no, listen. This may be a bit pushy cos we just met you but...

1156
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:55,072
 why don't you come back and sleep at our place?

1157
01:25:55,124 --> 01:25:57,282
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1158
01:25:57,334 --> 01:26:00,337
 Well, if it's not too much of an inconvenience.

1159
01:26:00,378 --> 01:26:03,412
 - Hell no! - But there's one problem.

1160
01:26:03,465 --> 01:26:05,591
 What?

1161
01:26:05,633 --> 01:26:09,293
 Well, we're not the richest of girls, you know.

1162
01:26:09,345 --> 01:26:14,339
 So we just have a little bed and no couch.

1163
01:26:14,391 --> 01:26:17,759
 So you'd have to share with all three of us.

1164
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:24,264
 And on this cold, cold night it's gonna be crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1165
01:26:24,316 --> 01:26:27,100
 And we can't even afford pyjamas.

1166
01:26:27,152 --> 01:26:29,561
 No?

1167
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:32,146
 Which means...

1168
01:26:32,198 --> 01:26:34,409
 we would be naked.

1169
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,737
 No, no, l think it'd be fine.

1170
01:26:40,789 --> 01:26:43,198
 - (Girls) Great. - Erm...

1171
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:46,367
 The thing that's gonna make it more crowded...

1172
01:26:46,419 --> 01:26:48,630
 Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.

1173
01:26:48,672 --> 01:26:50,548
 - There's a fourth? - Yeah.

1174
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:54,917
 Don't worry, you're totally gonna like her cos she is ''the sexy one''.

1175
01:26:54,969 --> 01:26:57,753
 - Really? Wow. - Yeah.

1176
01:26:57,805 --> 01:27:01,673
 - Praise the Lord! - Oh, and he's a Christian.

1432
01:44:29,283 --> 01:44:31,441
 She lives next door.

1433
01:44:33,912 --> 01:44:36,529
 Ah. Brilliant.

1434
01:44:36,581 --> 01:44:39,584
 You're not who l think you are, are you?

1435
01:44:39,625 --> 01:44:41,752
 Yes and l'm sorry about all the cockups.

1436
01:44:41,794 --> 01:44:45,245
 My cabinet are absolute crap. We hope to do better next year.

1437
01:44:45,297 --> 01:44:47,539
 Merry Christmas to you.

1438
01:45:00,185 --> 01:45:00,801
 (Doorbell)

1439
01:45:02,312 --> 01:45:06,139
 - (Chatting stops suddenly) - Ah. Hello.

1440
01:45:06,191 --> 01:45:08,474
 ls, er, Natalie in?

1441
01:45:08,526 --> 01:45:11,445
 Oh, where the fuck is my fucking coat?

1442
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:16,690
 - Oh. Hello. - Hello.

1443
01:45:16,742 --> 01:45:21,861
 Erm, this is my mum and my dad and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1444
01:45:21,913 --> 01:45:23,873
 - Hello. - Very nice to meet you.

1445
01:45:23,915 --> 01:45:27,741
 And, erm...this is the Prime Minister.

1446
01:45:27,793 --> 01:45:30,713
 Yes, we can see that, darling.

1447
01:45:30,754 --> 01:45:33,590
 And erm, unfortunately, we're very late.

1448
01:45:33,632 --> 01:45:36,749
 lt's the school Christmas concert, you see, David.

1449
01:45:36,801 --> 01:45:40,252
 All the local schools have joined together, even St Basil's...

1450
01:45:40,305 --> 01:45:44,173
 - Too much detail, Mum. - Anyway, how can we help, sir?

1451
01:45:44,225 --> 01:45:48,134
 Well, l...just needed Natalie...

1452
01:45:50,897 --> 01:45:52,972
 on some state business.

1453
01:45:53,024 --> 01:45:57,653
 - Oh. - Right, yes. Of course.

1454
01:45:57,695 --> 01:45:59,488
 Right, er...

1455
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:02,282
 Well, perhaps you should come on later, Plumpy.

1456
01:46:02,324 --> 01:46:03,732
 Er, Natalie.

1457
01:46:03,784 --> 01:46:06,317
 l don't want to make you late for the concert.

1458
01:46:06,369 --> 01:46:10,029
 - No, it's nothing, really. - Keith'll be very disappointed.

1459
01:46:10,081 --> 01:46:14,241
 - No, really, it doesn't matter. - The octopus costume's taken me months.

1460
01:46:14,293 --> 01:46:16,337
 Eight is a lot of legs, David.

1461
01:46:16,378 --> 01:46:18,912
 Mm. Erm...

1462
01:46:20,716 --> 01:46:22,842
 Listen, why don't l give you a lift

1463
01:46:22,884 --> 01:46:28,003
 and then we can talk about this state business business in the car.

1464
01:46:29,557 --> 01:46:31,100
 OK.

1465
01:46:31,141 --> 01:46:34,009
 - Lovely, yes. - Thank you.

1466
01:46:34,061 --> 01:46:36,188
 Hold tight, everybody.

1467
01:46:42,777 --> 01:46:45,613
 - How far is this place? - Just round the corner.

1468
01:46:45,654 --> 01:46:48,355
 Ah, right. Well, er...

1469
01:46:50,284 --> 01:46:52,525
 l just wanted to say...

1470
01:46:54,454 --> 01:46:56,612
 thank you for the Christmas card.

1471
01:46:56,664 --> 01:46:58,489
 You're welcome.

1472
01:46:58,541 --> 01:47:00,501
 Look, l'm so sorry about that day.

1473
01:47:00,543 --> 01:47:03,879
 l came in and he slinked towards me and there was a fire

1474
01:47:03,921 --> 01:47:08,414
 and he's the President of the United States and nothing happened, l promise.

1475
01:47:08,466 --> 01:47:11,636
 l just felt like such a fool because...

1476
01:47:11,678 --> 01:47:14,962
 l think about you all the time, actually.

1477
01:47:15,014 --> 01:47:18,434
 - And l think you're the man that l really... - We're here.

1478
01:47:18,475 --> 01:47:20,133
 - ..love. - Oh, wow.

1479
01:47:20,185 --> 01:47:22,854
 That really was just round the corner. Er...

1480
01:47:24,564 --> 01:47:26,639
 Erm...

1481
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:31,351
 Ow!

1482
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:37,815
 (Sighs)

1483
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,151
 Well, look, l...

1484
01:47:41,913 --> 01:47:44,446
 l think l'd better not come in, you know?

1485
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:49,002
 Nobody wants some politician stealing the kids' thunder.

1486
01:47:49,044 --> 01:47:52,662
 No, please come. lt'll be great.

1487
01:47:52,714 --> 01:47:55,414
 No, l'd...l'd better not.

1488
01:47:56,509 --> 01:48:01,336
 But l will be very sorry

1489
01:48:01,389 --> 01:48:03,515
 to drive away from you.

1490
01:48:04,975 --> 01:48:07,185
 Just give me one second.

1491
01:48:21,114 --> 01:48:24,284
 John's been very mysterious. Where did you two meet?

1492
01:48:24,326 --> 01:48:27,443
 - Erm...erm... - Um...um...

1493
01:48:30,539 --> 01:48:32,614
 No!

1494
01:49:03,944 --> 01:49:07,604
 Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

1495
01:49:07,656 --> 01:49:09,866
 OK. Terry, l won't be long.

1496
01:49:13,328 --> 01:49:16,247
 Look, this has to be a very secret visit, OK?

1497
01:49:16,289 --> 01:49:20,449
 Don't worry. This was my school. l know my way around. Come on.

1498
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:26,423
 Look, the sheep are ready already and you're not even...

1499
01:49:26,464 --> 01:49:30,510
 - Oh, David. - Ah!

1500
01:49:30,551 --> 01:49:32,876
 Oh, how are you?

1501
01:49:32,928 --> 01:49:37,005
 Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

1502
01:49:37,057 --> 01:49:39,215
 What the hell are you doing here?

1503
01:49:39,267 --> 01:49:42,301
 - Well, you know... - We always tell your secretary

1504
01:49:42,353 --> 01:49:47,097
 that these things are going on but it never occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

1505
01:49:47,149 --> 01:49:49,057
 l thought it was time l did.

1506
01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:52,529
 l didn't want anyone to see, so l'm gonna hide somewhere.

1507
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:55,021
 Good luck, Daisy, good luck, Bernie.

1508
01:49:55,073 --> 01:49:58,816
 l've never been gladder to see my stupid big brother.

1509
01:49:58,868 --> 01:50:02,152
 - Thank you. - All right.

1510
01:50:02,204 --> 01:50:05,155
 Oh, now. We haven't been introduced.

1511
01:50:05,207 --> 01:50:08,293

 Watch he keeps his hands off you.

1517
01:50:19,929 --> 01:50:22,139
 20 years ago, you'd have been his type.

1518
01:50:22,181 --> 01:50:27,133
 l'll be very careful. Don't try something, sir, just because it's Christmas.

1519
01:50:27,185 --> 01:50:29,343
 - No, seriously. - (Bell)

01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:28,239

01:55:10,062 --> 01:55:13,179
 and, come Christmas, gave it to somebody else.

1591
01:55:13,232 --> 01:55:16,015
 - Oh, Karen... - Would you wait around to find out...

1592
01:55:16,067 --> 01:55:18,736
 - Good night. - Night, darling. Happy Christmas.

1593
01:55:18,778 --> 01:55:21,781
 Would you wait around to find out if it's just a necklace

1594
01:55:21,822 --> 01:55:24,231
 or if it's sex and a necklace

1595
01:55:24,283 --> 01:55:27,984
 or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and love?

1596
01:55:29,246 --> 01:55:34,407
 Would you stay? Knowing life would always be a little bit worse?

1597
01:55:34,459 --> 01:55:37,962
 - Or would you cut and run? - Oh, God.

1598
01:55:42,549 --> 01:55:45,385
 l am so in the wrong.

1599
01:55:45,427 --> 01:55:47,502
 A classic fool.

1600
01:55:47,554 --> 01:55:50,755
 Yes, but you've also made a fool out of me.

1601
01:55:50,807 --> 01:55:53,674
 You've made the life l lead foolish, too.

1602
01:55:56,061 --> 01:55:59,064
 Darling. Ooh, darlings!

1603
01:55:59,106 --> 01:56:02,306
 Oh, you were wonderful.

1604
01:56:02,359 --> 01:56:05,393
 My little lobster, you were so...

1605
01:56:05,445 --> 01:56:07,770
 What is that word?

1606
01:56:07,822 --> 01:56:10,063
 Orange.

1607
01:56:10,116 --> 01:56:13,202
 Come on, l've got treats at home. Dad's coming.

1608
01:56:14,661 --> 01:56:19,405
 Sammy! Fantastic show! Classic drumming, son.

1609
01:56:19,457 --> 01:56:23,534
 - Thanks. Plan didn't work, though. - Tell her, then.

1610
01:56:23,586 --> 01:56:25,494
 - Tell her what? - That you love her.

1611
01:56:25,546 --> 01:56:28,496
 No way. Anyway, they fly tonight.

1612
01:56:28,549 --> 01:56:33,887
 Even better. Sam, you've got nothing to lose and you'll always regret it if you don't.

1613
01:56:35,471 --> 01:56:37,713
 l never told your mum enough.

1614
01:56:37,765 --> 01:56:42,227
 l should have told her every day because she was perfect every day.

1615
01:56:43,353 --> 01:56:47,649
 You've seen the films, kiddo. lt ain't over till it's over.

1616
01:56:49,609 --> 01:56:54,353
 OK, Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit kicked out of us by love.

1617
01:56:54,405 --> 01:56:56,730
 Yes.

1618
01:56:56,782 --> 01:56:59,107
 - Just give me one sec. - Yeah.

1619
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:03,528
 - Oh, l'm sorry. - Sorry.

1620
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:05,738
 That's OK.

1621
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:09,241
 - My fault. - No, no, really, it wasn't.

1622
01:57:09,293 --> 01:57:12,212
 You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1623
01:57:12,254 --> 01:57:15,173
 Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

1624
01:57:15,215 --> 01:57:18,051
 - Daniel. - l'm Carol.

1625
01:57:18,093 --> 01:57:19,886
 Carol.

1626
01:57:19,928 --> 01:57:24,338
 - OK, l'm back. Let's go. - Yeah. Well...

1627
01:57:25,725 --> 01:57:28,050
 l hope we'll meet again, Karen.

1628
01:57:28,102 --> 01:57:30,343
 Carol. (Laughs)

1629
01:57:31,688 --> 01:57:36,317
 - l'll make sure we do. - Yeah? Good.

1630
01:57:37,944 --> 01:57:40,019
 (Carol laughs)

1631
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:46,232
 - Tell her. - What?

1632
01:57:46,285 --> 01:57:49,318
 - You know... - Don't be such an arse.

1633
01:57:52,957 --> 01:57:55,084
 - Look, there she is. - Where?

1634
01:57:55,126 --> 01:57:57,409
 Over there.

1635
01:57:59,254 --> 01:58:01,298
 Oh, no.

1636
01:58:02,382 --> 01:58:05,385
 lt's OK, we'll go to the airport. l know a short cut.

1637
01:58:20,565 --> 01:58:22,692
 (Portuguese) Good evening.

1638
01:58:22,734 --> 01:58:25,768
 - Senhor Barros? - Sim.

1639
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:29,521
 l am here to ask your daughter

1640
01:58:29,573 --> 01:58:31,533
 for her hands in marriage.

1641
01:58:31,575 --> 01:58:33,816
 You want to marry my daughter?

1642
01:58:33,869 --> 01:58:35,777
 Yes.

1643
01:58:35,829 --> 01:58:37,288
 Come here,

1644
01:58:37,330 --> 01:58:38,873
 there is a man at the door.

1645
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:42,668
 He wants to marry you.

1646
01:58:42,710 --> 01:58:44,086
 But l've never seen him before.

1647
01:58:44,128 --> 01:58:45,535
 Who cares?

1648
01:58:45,587 --> 01:58:47,829
 You're going to sell me to a complete stranger?

1649
01:58:47,881 --> 01:58:50,915
 Sell? Who said sell? l'll pay him.

1650
01:58:50,967 --> 01:58:55,711
 Pardon me. l'm meaning your other daughter - Aurelia.

1651
01:58:55,763 --> 01:58:59,506
 She's not here - she's at work. l'll take you.

1652
01:58:59,558 --> 01:59:01,049
 You! Stay here.

1653
01:59:01,101 --> 01:59:04,052
 As if l would. Stupid!

1654
01:59:06,981 --> 01:59:11,777
 Father is about to sell Aurelia as a slave to this Englishman.

1655
01:59:15,572 --> 01:59:17,647
 Wait. Wait.

1656
01:59:20,994 --> 01:59:22,401
 Oh, no.

1657
01:59:23,913 --> 01:59:25,790
 You better not say yes, Father.

1658
01:59:25,832 --> 01:59:28,834
 Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1659
01:59:33,964 --> 01:59:37,582
 - Look, we're not actually flying. - You can't come through.

1660
01:59:37,634 --> 01:59:42,044
 Not even to let the boy say goodbye to the love of his life?

1661
01:59:43,764 --> 01:59:45,724
 No.

1662
01:59:47,809 --> 01:59:51,010
 - l'm sorry, Sam. - Boarding pass, sir?

1663
01:59:51,062 --> 01:59:54,649
 Just a moment, l know l've got it. Would you hang on to that?

1664
01:59:54,691 --> 01:59:56,734
 - Unless... - What?

1665
01:59:56,776 --> 01:59:59,351
 - Do you want to make a run for it? - Hold on to that.

1666
01:59:59,403 --> 02:00:01,937
 - You think l should? - Yeah.

1667
02:00:02,573 --> 02:00:05,690
 - OK. - Yes!

1668
02:00:05,742 --> 02:00:10,121
 l must have left them where l was having a cup of coffee.

1669
02:00:27,303 --> 02:00:30,055
 (Beeping)

1670
02:01:11,926 --> 02:01:14,543
 (lnaudible through glass)

1671
02:01:15,721 --> 02:01:18,129
 (Chattering excitedly)

1672
02:01:22,936 --> 02:01:25,553
 Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1673
02:01:25,605 --> 02:01:27,815
 Cool!

1674
02:02:02,054 --> 02:02:04,129
 Joanna.

1675
02:02:05,182 --> 02:02:07,257
 Sam?

1676
02:02:10,478 --> 02:02:14,774
 - l thought you didn't know my name. - Course l do.

1677
02:02:14,815 --> 02:02:18,517
 Oh, Jesus. Here, l've gotta run.

1678
02:03:11,032 --> 02:03:13,607
 - (Portuguese) Where is Aurelia? - Why should l tell you?

1679
02:03:13,659 --> 02:03:15,703
 This man wants to marry her.

1680
02:03:15,745 --> 02:03:18,497
 He can't do that - she's our best waitress.

1681
02:03:37,431 --> 02:03:39,224
 Boa noite, Aurelia.

1682
02:03:40,767 --> 02:03:42,842
 Boa noite, Jamie.

1683
02:03:58,157 --> 02:04:01,160
 Beautiful Aurelia...

1684
02:04:01,202 --> 02:04:05,414
 l've come here with a view to asking you...

1685
02:04:06,498 --> 02:04:08,708
 to marriage me.

1686
02:04:10,043 --> 02:04:14,870
 l know l seems an insane person because l hardly knows you

1687
02:04:16,507 --> 02:04:23,503
 but sometimes things are so transparency,

1688
02:04:24,806 --> 02:04:28,226
 they don't need evidential proof.

1689
02:04:30,144 --> 02:04:36,150
 And l will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England.

1690
02:04:36,191 --> 02:04:38,725
 Definitely go for England, girl.

1691
02:04:38,777 --> 02:04:42,061
 You'll meet Prince William - then you can marry him instead.

1692
02:04:43,072 --> 02:04:49,078
 Of course l don't expecting you to be as foolish as me,

1693
02:04:49,954 --> 02:04:54,666
 and of course l prediction you say no....

1694
02:04:55,750 --> 02:05:03,664
 but it's Christmas and l just wanted to...check.

1695
02:05:07,886 --> 02:05:11,504
 Oh, God - say yes, you skinny moron.

1696
02:05:14,309 --> 02:05:16,383
 (English) Thank you.

1697
02:05:18,187 --> 02:05:20,262
 That will be nice.

1698
02:05:22,524 --> 02:05:25,308
 Yes is being my answer.

1699
02:05:26,987 --> 02:05:29,312
 Easy question.

1700
02:05:29,364 --> 02:05:31,814
 (Portuguese) What did you say?

1701
02:05:31,866 --> 02:05:33,242
 Yes, of course.

1702

1703
02:05:35,995 --> 02:05:38,320
 Bravo!

1704
02:06:03,686 --> 02:06:05,844
 (English) You learned English?

1705
02:06:06,355 --> 02:06:08,565

 He never tells me this.

1716
02:07:09,036 --> 02:07:12,205
 l think maybe now l have made the wrong choice,

1717
02:07:12,247 --> 02:07:13,957
 picked wrong Englishman.

1718
