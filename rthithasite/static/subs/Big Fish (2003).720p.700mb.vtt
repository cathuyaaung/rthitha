00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.850
<i>There are some fish
that cannot be caught.

3
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.022
<i>It's not that they're faster
or stronger than other fish.

4
00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.359
<i>They're just touched
by something extra.

5
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.279
<i>One such fish was The Beast.

6
00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:17.035
<i>And by the time I was born
he was already a legend.

7
00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:21.790
<i>He'd passed up more $100 lures
than any fish in Alabama.

8
00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.961
<i>Some said that fish was
the ghost of a thief...

9
00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:29.339
<i>who'd drowned in that river
60 years before.

10
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:35.554
Others claimed he was a dinosaur
left over from the "Cruaceous"Period.

11
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.558
I didn't put any stock into
such speculation or superstition.

12
00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:42.394
All I knew was I'd been trying
to catch that fish

13
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.063
since I was a boy
no bigger than you.

14
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.066
And on the day you were born...

15
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.236
Well, that was the day
I finally caught him.

16
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.906
Now, I'd tried everything on it:

17
00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:58.910
Worms, lures, peanut butter,
peanut butter and cheese.

18
00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.705
But on that day I had a revelation:

19
00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:06.710
If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost,
then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.

20
00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:11.173
I was gonna have to use something
he truly desired.

21
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.759
- Your finger?
- Gold.

22
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.805
Now, I tied my ring onto
the strongest line they made

23
00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:23.226
strong enough to hold up a bridge,
they said, if only for a few minutes.

24
00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.105
And then I cast upriver.

25
00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:34.488
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before it even hit the water.

26
00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:39.117
And just as fast,
he snapped clean through that line.

27
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.952
Well, you can see my predicament.

28
00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:45.123
My wedding ring,
the symbol of fidelity to my wife

29
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:48.043
soon to be mother of my child...
- Make him stop.

30
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.129
...was now lost in the gut
of an uncatchable fish.

31
00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:52.964
What did you do?

32
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:56.426
I followed that fish upriver
and downriver.

33
00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:00.555
This fish, The Beast

34
00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:06.686
the whole time we were calling it
a him, when in fact it was a her.

35
00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.147
It was fat with eggs
it was gonna lay any day.

36
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.983
Now, I was in a situation.

37
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.821
I could gut that fish
and get my wedding ring back

38
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:21.243
but in doing so I'd be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River.

39
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.829
Did I want to deprive
my son the chance

40
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.040
to catch a fish like this
of his own?

41
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.835
This ladyfish and I...

42
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:34.506
- Well, we had the same destiny.
- "We were part of the same equation."

43
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.717
Now, you may well ask...

44
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:41.638
Oh, darling, darling,
it's still your night.

45
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:47.686
...why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?

46
00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.981
That was the lesson
I learned that day

47
00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:54.192
the day my son was born.

48
00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:00.407
Sometimes the only way to catch
an uncatchable woman

49
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:04.119
is to offer her a wedding ring.

50
00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.213
What, a father's not allowed
to talk about his son?

51
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.215
I'm a footnote in that story, Dad

52
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:23.388
the context for your great adventure,
which never happened, incidentally.

53
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.725
You were selling novelty products
in Wichita when I was born.

54
00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.478
Come on, Will.
Everyone loves that story!

55
00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:34.024
They don't. I don't love that story. Not
anymore. Not after a thousand times!

56
00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:38.111
I know every punch line, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can!

57
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.573
For one night,
one night in your entire life

58
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.910
the universe did not revolve
around Edward Bloom.

59
00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:49.331
- How can you not understand that?
- I'm sorry to embarrass you.

60
00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:53.418
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.

61
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:59.591
<i>After that night, I didn't speak
to my father again for three years.

62
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:09.100
William Bloom, United Press
lnternational. If I could just...

63
00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.440
<i>We communicated indirectly, I guess.

64
00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:19.611
<i>In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother wrote for both of them.

65
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:24.866
<i>And when I'd call, she'd say Dad was
out driving or swimming in the pool.

66
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.078
<i>True to form, we never
talked about not talking.

67
00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:34.793
<i>The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father.

68
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.296
<i>And I don't think he saw anything
of himself in me.

69
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.428
<i>We were like strangers
who knew each other very well.

70
00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.894
<i>In telling the story
of my father's life...

71
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:57.566
<i>it's impossible to separate fact
from fiction, the man from the myth.

72
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.197
<i>The best I can do
is to tell it the way he told me.

73
00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.411
<i>It doesn't always ma sense,
and most of it never happened.

74
00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:37.147
Give me back my ring!

75
00:06:49.493 --> 00:06:51.036
Thank you!

76
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.581
<i>But that's what kind of story this is.

77
00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:06.885
<i>His birth would set the pace
for his unlikely life.

78
00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:10.096
<i>No longer than most men's ,
but larger.

79
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.641
<i>And as strange as his stories got...

80
00:07:12.808 --> 00:07:16.311
<i>the endings were always
the most surprising of all.

81
00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.799
Yes. Yes, he's here.

82
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.718
It's your mother.

83
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.561
And what does Dr. Bennett say?

84
00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.773
No, sure, I'll talk to him.

85
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.776
Yeah, I'll wait.

86
00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.444
It's bad?

87
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:10.740
Yeah, it's more than they thought.
They're gonna stop chemo.

88
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.619
- You need to go.
- Probably tonight.

89
00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:19.040
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no. You shouldn't.

90
00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.001
I'm going with you.

91
00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:52.157
Now, which one's it gonna be?

92
00:08:52.324 --> 00:08:55.160
"Monkey in a Barn,"
or "Dog in the Road"?

93
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.537
The one about the witch.

94
00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.499
Your momma says I can't
tell you that one anymore.

95
00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.544
- You get nightmares.
- But I'm not scared.

96
00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.840
Well, neither was I, at first.

97
00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:12.260
Now, this took place
in the swamp outside of Ashton.

98
00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:17.098
Children weren't allowed in the swamp
on account of the snakes, spiders

99
00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:21.895
and quicksand that would swallow
you up before you could even scream.

100
00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.314
There were five of us
out there that night:

101
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.318
<i>Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely...

102
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:32.155
<i>and the Price Brothers,
Don and Zacky.

103
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:36.159
<i>And not one of us knew
what was in store.

104
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:40.914
<i>It's common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch...

105
00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.291
<i>if only to eat
misbehaving children...

106
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:46.670
<i>and the occasional puppy
who wanders into her yard.

107
00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:50.006
<i>Witches use those bones
to cast spells and curses...

108
00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.551
<i>and make the land infertile.

109
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.888
- Is it true she got a glass eye?
- I heard she got it from gypsies.

110
00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.224
- What's a gypsy?
- Your momma's a gypsy.

111
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:00.725
Your momma's a bitch.

112
00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.103
You shouldn't swear.
There's ladies present.

113
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.521
- Shit.
- Damn.

114
00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:05.730
Screw.

115
00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.024
Turn off your flashlights.
She'll see you!

116
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.819
<i>Yet of all the witches in Alabama...

117
00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:13.905
<i>there was one who was said
to be the most feared.

118
00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:18.160
<i>For she had one glass eye which
was said to contain mystical powers.

119
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:22.205
I heard if you look right at it,
you'll see how you're gonna die.

120
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:26.084
That's bull-S-H-I-T, that is.
She's not even a real witch.

121
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.295
If you're so sure, go get that eye.

122
00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:33.091
I heard she keeps it in a box on her
night table. Or are you too scared?

123
00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.427
I'll go in right now and get that eye.

124
00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:37.679
- Then do it.
- Fine, I will.

125
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.807
- Fine, you do it.
- Fine, I'm doing it.

126
00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.268
Edward, don't!

127
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:47.355
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.

128
00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.192
She makes soap out of people.

129
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.327
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom

130
00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:45.163
and there's some folks
like to see your eye.

131
00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.303
- You get The Eye?
- I brought it.

132
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.596
Let's see it.

133
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.146
Whoa, help!

134
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.285
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old and I fell.

135
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.455
I wasn't old at all.

136
00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:37.549
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.

137
00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:41.219
I mean, on one hand,
if dying was all you thought about

138
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.221
it could kind of screw you up.

139
00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:47.142
But it could kind of help you,
couldn't it?

140
00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:51.396
Because, everything else,
you'd know you could survive.

141
00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.319
I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.

142
00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.791
That's how I go.

143
00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.523
Hi, Mom.

144
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:45.659
- Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
- Yes. He's up with your father now.

145
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:49.538
- And how is he?
- Well... No, I got it.

146
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:53.792
He's impossible. He won't eat.
Because he doesn't eat, he's weaker.

147
00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:56.044
Because he's weak,
he doesn't want to eat.

148
00:13:56.211 --> 00:14:01.091
- How much time does he have left?
- You don't talk about that.

149
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.968
Not yet.

150
00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.138
Will.

151
00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.225
Dr. Bennett. Oh, it's good to see you.

152
00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.978
My wife, Josephine.

153
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.147
A pleasure.

154
00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:19.526
- You're seven months.
- To the day!

155
00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:22.821
It's a boy.

156
00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:31.163
Try to get him to drink one of these.
He won't, but go ahead and try.

157
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.335
Dad?

158
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:31.932
You want some water?

159
00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:52.577
- You are in for a surprise.
- Am I?

160
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.705
Having a kid changes everything.

161
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:59.626
There's the diapers and the burping
and the midnight feeding.

162
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.796
- Did you do any of that?
- No.

163
00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.423
But I hear it's terrible.

164
00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:11.054
Then you spend years trying
to corrupt and mislead this child

165
00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:16.017
fill its head with nonsense,
and still it turns out perfectly fine.

166
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:21.148
- You think I'm up for it?
- You learned from the best.

167
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.946
Drink half the can.
I'll tell Mom you drank it all.

168
00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:29.656
Everyone wins.

169
00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:34.119
People needn't worry so much.
It's not my time yet.

170
00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:36.246
This is not how I go.

171
00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:40.625
- Really?
- Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

172
00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:44.588
- The old lady by the swamp?
- She was a witch.

173
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:47.424
No, she was old and probably senile.

174
00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:52.762
I saw my death in that eye,
and this isn't how it happens.

175
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.973
So how does it happen?

176
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.728
Surprise ending.
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

177
00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:03.773
Your mother thought
we wouldn't talk again.

178
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.735
Look at us. We're talking fine.

179
00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:08.778
We're storytellers, both of us.

180
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:14.451
I speak mine out,
you write yours down. Same thing.

181
00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.537
Dad...

182
00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:22.959
I hope to talk about some things
while I'm here.

183
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.337
You mean while I'm here.

184
00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:29.508
I just want to know
the true versions of things:

185
00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:32.511
Events. Stories.

186
00:17:32.803 --> 00:17:34.012
You.

187
00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:48.360
Your mother hasn't been
keeping up the pool.

188
00:17:48.527 --> 00:17:52.197
- If you wanted to, you could fix it.
- Yeah, I will.

189
00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:55.617
- You know where the chemicals are?
- I did it when you were gone.

190
00:17:55.784 --> 00:18:01.790
I was never much for being
at home, Will. Too confining.

191
00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:05.043
And this here, being stuck in bed...

192
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.713
Dying is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

193
00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:15.345
- I thought you said you weren't dying.
- I said this isn't how I go.

194
00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:19.391
The last part is much more unusual.

195
00:18:19.558 --> 00:18:21.893
Trust me on that.

196
00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:57.762
Dr. Bennett said I have
to stay at home for a week.

197
00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:01.641
Oh, that's nothing. Once,
I had to stay in bed for three years.

198
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:05.061
- Did you have the chickenpox?
- I wish.

199
00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:27.292
<i>Truth is, no one quite knew
what was wrong.

200
00:19:27.626 --> 00:19:30.128
<i>Most times a person
grows up gradually...

201
00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.631
<i>while I found myself in a hurry.

202
00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:40.055
<i>My muscles and my bones couldn't
keep up with my body's ambition.

203
00:19:40.222 --> 00:19:43.683
<i>So I spent the better part
of three years confined to my bed...

204
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.813
<i>with the encyclopaedia being
my only means of exploration.

205
00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.981
<i>I had made it all the way to the G's ...

206
00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:53.026
<i>hoping to find an answer
to my " gigantificationism" ...

207
00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:57.030
<i>when I uncovered an article
about the common goldfish.

208
00:19:57.239 --> 00:20:01.159
"Kept in a small bowl,
the goldfish will remain small.

209
00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.661
With more space

210
00:20:02.828 --> 00:20:06.665
the fish will grow double, triple,
or quadruple its size."

211
00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:10.085
<i>It occurred to me then that perhaps
the reason for my growth...

212
00:20:10.252 --> 00:20:12.796
<i>was that I was intended
for larger things.

213
00:20:12.963 --> 00:20:16.508
<i>After all, a giant man can't have
an ordinary-sized life.

214
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:21.346
<i>As soon as my bones had settled
in their adult configuration...

215
00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:26.309
<i>I set upon my plan to make
a bigger place for myself in Ashton.

216
00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:27.727
<i>Tigers, go!

217
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.953
Edward Bloom!

218
00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:31.833
Doggy! My doggy!
My doggie's trapped!

219
00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:44.095
<i>I was the biggest thing
Ashton had ever seen.

220
00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:47.891
<i>Until one day, a stranger arrived.

221
00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:07.786
Calm down. Calm down, everybody.
Calm down. That's enough.

222
00:22:07.953 --> 00:22:11.706
- Mr. Mayor, he ate an entire corn field.
- He ate my dog.

223
00:22:11.873 --> 00:22:14.459
If you ain't gonna stop him, mayor,
we will.

224
00:22:14.626 --> 00:22:17.712
I won't have mob violence
in this town.

225
00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:19.798
Now, has someone tried
talking to him?

226
00:22:19.965 --> 00:22:22.634
- You can't reason with him.
- He's a monster.

227
00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:24.594
I'll do it.

228
00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:41.611
I'll talk to him.
See if I can get him to go.

229
00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:44.156
That creature could crush you
without trying.

230
00:22:44.322 --> 00:22:47.325
Oh, trust me, he'll have to try.

231
00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:20.358
Hello?

232
00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:27.949
My name is Edward Bloom,
and I wanna talk to you!

233
00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:31.119
Go away!

234
00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:36.082
Now, I'm not going anywhere
until you show yourself!

235
00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:39.252
I said, go away!

236
00:23:59.648 --> 00:24:02.067
<i>Armed with the foreknowledge
of my own death...

237
00:24:02.234 --> 00:24:04.402
<i>I knew the giant couldn't kill me.

238
00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:09.991
<i>All the same, I preferred to keep
my bones unbroken.

239
00:24:10.158 --> 00:24:12.160
Why are you here?

240
00:24:13.453 --> 00:24:14.955
So you can eat me.

241
00:24:15.413 --> 00:24:19.376
The town decided to send
a human sacrifice and I volunteered.

242
00:24:19.543 --> 00:24:23.130
My arms are a little stringy, but
there's some good eating in my legs.

243
00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:26.550
I mean, I'd be tempted
to eat them myself.

244
00:24:28.677 --> 00:24:30.762
So I guess, well...

245
00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:35.225
If you'd just get it over with quick,
because I'm not much for pain, really.

246
00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:51.408
Oh, come on! I can't go back!
I'm a human sacrifice!

247
00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:54.119
If I go back,
they'll think I'm a coward.

248
00:24:54.286 --> 00:24:56.872
I'd rather be dinner than a coward.

249
00:24:57.456 --> 00:24:58.707
Here.

250
00:24:59.207 --> 00:25:02.294
You can start with my hand.
It'll be an appetizer.

251
00:25:02.461 --> 00:25:06.631
I don't want to eat you.
I don't want to eat anybody.

252
00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:10.927
I just get so hungry.
I'm just too big.

253
00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:14.890
Did you ever think that
maybe you're not too big

254
00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:17.184
but maybe this town
is just too small?

255
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.228
I've heard in real cities
there are buildings so tall

256
00:25:20.395 --> 00:25:22.647
you can't even see
the tops of them.

257
00:25:22.814 --> 00:25:25.317
- Really?
- Oh, I wouldn't lie to you.

258
00:25:25.484 --> 00:25:27.611
And all-you-can-eat buffets.

259
00:25:27.777 --> 00:25:30.780
- Now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
- I can.

260
00:25:30.947 --> 00:25:33.825
So why are you wasting your time
in a small town?

261
00:25:33.992 --> 00:25:37.120
You're a big man.
You should be in a big city.

262
00:25:37.287 --> 00:25:40.499
You're just trying to get me
to leave, aren't you?

263
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:44.336
- What's your name, giant?
- Karl.

264
00:25:44.503 --> 00:25:47.923
Well, mine's Edward.
And truthfully...

265
00:25:48.089 --> 00:25:51.927
Well, I do want you to leave, Karl.
But I want to leave with you.

266
00:25:52.093 --> 00:25:54.846
I mean, you think this town
is too small for you?

267
00:25:55.013 --> 00:25:58.141
Well, it's too small for a man
of my ambition.

268
00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:01.478
So, what do you say? Join me?

269
00:26:04.689 --> 00:26:05.899
Okay.

270
00:26:07.234 --> 00:26:08.735
Okay.

271
00:26:09.027 --> 00:26:12.197
Now, first, we gotta
get you ready for the city.

272
00:26:28.964 --> 00:26:33.218
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton

273
00:26:33.385 --> 00:26:36.888
it's with a heavy heart
that we see you go.

274
00:26:37.055 --> 00:26:39.724
But take with you
this key to the city

275
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:42.853
and know that any time
you want to come back

276
00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:46.064
all our doors are open to you.

277
00:26:54.573 --> 00:26:58.618
<i>That afternoon as I left Ashton,
everyone seemed to have advice.

278
00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:01.663
Find yourself a nice girl, now!

279
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.083
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

280
00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:09.671
<i>But there was one person whose
counsel I held above all others.

281
00:27:13.758 --> 00:27:16.470
<i>She said that the biggest fish
in the river...

282
00:27:16.636 --> 00:27:19.806
<i>gets that way
by never being caught.

283
00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:27.731
- What'd she say?
- Beats me.

284
00:27:39.743 --> 00:27:41.578
<i>There were two roads out of Ashtonl

285
00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:44.623
<i>A new one which was paved
and an older one that wasn't .

286
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.792
<i>People didn't use
the old one anymore...

287
00:27:46.958 --> 00:27:49.795
<i>and it had developed a reputation
for being haunted.

288
00:27:49.961 --> 00:27:53.131
<i>Well, since I had no intention
of ever returning to Ashton...

289
00:27:53.298 --> 00:27:57.469
<i>this seemed as good a time as any
to find out what lay down that old one.

290
00:27:57.636 --> 00:28:02.390
- You know anyone who's taken it?
- That poet, Norther Winslow, did.

291
00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:05.310
He was going to Paris, France.

292
00:28:05.477 --> 00:28:08.939
I guess he liked it.
No one ever heard from him again.

293
00:28:09.147 --> 00:28:11.316
I'll tell you what.
You go the other way.

294
00:28:11.483 --> 00:28:15.028
I'll cut through here,
and I'll meet you on the far side.

295
00:28:16.238 --> 00:28:19.324
You're just trying to run away,
aren't you?

296
00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:22.285
Here.

297
00:28:23.578 --> 00:28:26.665
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

298
00:29:05.871 --> 00:29:07.831
Why, you son of a...

299
00:29:33.773 --> 00:29:36.401
<i>Now, there comes a point
when a reasonable man...

300
00:29:36.568 --> 00:29:41.323
<i>will swallow his pride and admit
that he's made a terrible mistake.

301
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:46.411
<i>The truth is,
I was never a reasonable man.

302
00:29:47.579 --> 00:29:50.290
<i>And what I recall of
Sunday school was that...

303
00:29:50.457 --> 00:29:55.587
<i>the more difficult something is,
the more rewarding it is in the end.

304
00:30:54.813 --> 00:30:57.607
Friend! Welcome to you!

305
00:30:58.024 --> 00:31:01.027
- What's your name?
- Edward Bloom.

306
00:31:02.154 --> 00:31:05.240
- "Bloom"like a flower?
- Yes.

307
00:31:05.407 --> 00:31:09.578
Oh, here! Here you are, right here.
"Edward Bloom."

308
00:31:09.744 --> 00:31:12.080
We weren't expecting you yet.

309
00:31:12.247 --> 00:31:14.332
- You were expecting me?
- Not yet.

310
00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:19.171
- You must've taken a shortcut.
- Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.

311
00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:23.842
Life will do that to you.
And truthfully, the long way is easier.

312
00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:27.137
- But it's longer.
- Much longer.

313
00:31:27.304 --> 00:31:30.223
And you're here now,
and that's what matters.

314
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.641
What is this place?

315
00:31:31.808 --> 00:31:35.061
The town of Spectre.
Best-kept secret in Alabama!

316
00:31:35.228 --> 00:31:38.607
Now, it says here
you're from Ashton, right?

317
00:31:38.773 --> 00:31:42.110
Last person we had from Ashton
was Norther Winslow.

318
00:31:42.277 --> 00:31:44.196
The poet?
Whatever happened to him?

319
00:31:44.362 --> 00:31:48.742
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.

320
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:50.869
Hell, I'll have him tell you!

321
00:31:51.036 --> 00:31:54.164
I have to meet somebody,
and I'm already running late.

322
00:31:54.331 --> 00:31:58.210
Now, son, I already told you.
You're early.

323
00:32:32.744 --> 00:32:35.872
Now, tell me if that isn't
the best pie you ever ate.

324
00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:37.749
It truly is.

325
00:32:42.087 --> 00:32:46.007
Well, everything tastes better here.
Even the water is sweet.

326
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.763
Never gets too hot,
too cold, too humid.

327
00:32:52.264 --> 00:32:55.475
At night, the wind goes through
the trees where you'd swear

328
00:32:55.642 --> 00:32:59.020
there was a whole symphony
out there playing just for you.

329
00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:04.025
Hey! Jenny!

330
00:33:05.026 --> 00:33:06.820
Come back here!

331
00:33:12.534 --> 00:33:13.952
Jenny!

332
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:31.303
Hey, I need those.

333
00:33:31.803 --> 00:33:35.140
- There is no softer ground than town.
- That almost rhymes.

334
00:33:35.307 --> 00:33:37.809
He's our poet laureate. Come on.

335
00:33:41.354 --> 00:33:44.858
<i>I agreed to spend the afternoon,
if only to understand...

336
00:33:45.025 --> 00:33:49.905
<i>the mystery of how a place could
feel so strange and yet so familiar.

337
00:33:53.825 --> 00:33:56.369
I've been working on this poem
for 12 years.

338
00:33:56.536 --> 00:33:58.163
Really?

339
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:03.126
There's a lot of expectation.
I don't wanna disappoint my fans.

340
00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:05.670
May I?

341
00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:27.609
It's only three lines long.

342
00:34:30.946 --> 00:34:34.199
This is why you should never show
a work in progress.

343
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.840
I got him!

344
00:35:47.439 --> 00:35:49.107
There's leeches in there.

345
00:35:50.066 --> 00:35:53.111
- Did you see that woman?
- What did she look like?

346
00:35:53.278 --> 00:35:56.740
- Well, she was...
- Was she naked?

347
00:35:59.075 --> 00:36:00.619
Yes, she was.

348
00:36:00.786 --> 00:36:05.040
It's not a woman. It's a fish.
No one ever catches her.

349
00:36:05.207 --> 00:36:07.709
Fish looks different
to different people.

350
00:36:08.001 --> 00:36:11.797
My daddy said it looked like the
coon dog he had when he was a kid

351
00:36:12.214 --> 00:36:14.716
back from the dead.

352
00:36:18.136 --> 00:36:19.971
Oh, darn.

353
00:36:21.932 --> 00:36:24.142
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

354
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:28.230
I'm 8. That means when I'm 18,
you'll be 28.

355
00:36:28.396 --> 00:36:33.151
- And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
- You're pretty good at arithmetic.

356
00:36:33.318 --> 00:36:37.823
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
That's not much difference at all.

357
00:36:37.989 --> 00:36:40.826
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

358
00:37:14.568 --> 00:37:17.195
Hey, Edward!

359
00:37:26.288 --> 00:37:30.125
<i>Roses are red
Violets are blue

360
00:37:30.292 --> 00:37:32.836
<i>I love Spectre...

361
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.552
Excuse me.

362
00:37:46.725 --> 00:37:50.187
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.

363
00:37:51.021 --> 00:37:52.355
What?

364
00:37:52.522 --> 00:37:55.734
I said, you're quite a catch.

365
00:38:18.006 --> 00:38:19.758
I have to leave.

366
00:38:23.804 --> 00:38:25.180
Tonight.

367
00:38:25.639 --> 00:38:26.932
Why?

368
00:38:28.266 --> 00:38:30.811
This town is more than any man
could ask for.

369
00:38:30.977 --> 00:38:34.523
And if I were to end up here,
I would consider myself lucky.

370
00:38:34.689 --> 00:38:38.610
But the truth is, I'm just not ready
to end up anywhere.

371
00:38:39.194 --> 00:38:40.904
But no one's ever left.

372
00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:45.450
How are you gonna make it
without your shoes?

373
00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:48.286
Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.

374
00:38:52.207 --> 00:38:54.876
Now, I'm sorry, but...
Well, goodbye.

375
00:38:58.547 --> 00:39:02.217
- You won't find a better place.
- I don't expect to.

376
00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:09.391
Promise me you'll come back.

377
00:39:10.851 --> 00:39:15.647
I promise. Someday.
When I'm really supposed to.

378
00:39:46.636 --> 00:39:49.473
<i>That night,
I reached two conclusions.

379
00:39:50.265 --> 00:39:55.312
<i>The first was that a dangerous path
is made much worse by darkness.

380
00:39:55.479 --> 00:40:00.192
<i>The second was that I was
hopelessly and irrevocably lost.

381
00:40:00.776 --> 00:40:03.779
<i>These woods would become
my graveyard.

382
00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:10.911
<i>As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,
I was fated to get there eventually.

383
00:40:11.077 --> 00:40:14.498
<i>After all, no man can avoid
reaching the end of his life.

384
00:40:29.137 --> 00:40:33.391
<i>And then I realized
this wasn't the end of my life.

385
00:40:33.558 --> 00:40:36.561
This isn't how I die.

386
00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:55.413
Friend.

387
00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.501
- What happened to your shoes?
- They kind of got ahead of me.

388
00:41:16.434 --> 00:41:19.437
I don't know if you saw it,
but Josephine had some photos

389
00:41:19.604 --> 00:41:21.189
in the most recent Newsweek.

390
00:41:23.733 --> 00:41:25.235
Really?

391
00:41:25.402 --> 00:41:26.736
That's just wonderful.

392
00:41:28.572 --> 00:41:33.076
I spent a week in Morocco
for the story. It was incredible.

393
00:41:33.243 --> 00:41:37.706
Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.

394
00:41:48.049 --> 00:41:51.136
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine

395
00:41:51.595 --> 00:41:56.766
but African parrots, in their native
Congo, they speak only French.

396
00:41:57.851 --> 00:41:59.144
Really?

397
00:41:59.728 --> 00:42:03.023
You're lucky to get four words
out of them in English.

398
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.109
But if you were to walk
through the jungle

399
00:42:06.276 --> 00:42:09.988
you'd hear them speaking
the most elaborate French.

400
00:42:10.655 --> 00:42:15.827
Those parrots talk about everything.
Politics, movies, fashion.

401
00:42:15.994 --> 00:42:18.663
Everything but religion.

402
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.124
Why not religion, Dad?

403
00:42:21.833 --> 00:42:26.505
It's rude to talk about religion. You
never know who you're gonna offend.

404
00:42:31.843 --> 00:42:35.013
Josephine actually went
to the Congo last year.

405
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:38.725
Oh, so you know.

406
00:42:54.366 --> 00:42:56.827
Hello.

407
00:42:56.993 --> 00:42:59.371
Hi. How are you feeling?

408
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.667
Oh, I was dreaming.

409
00:43:04.209 --> 00:43:06.711
What were you dreaming about?

410
00:43:07.754 --> 00:43:10.799
Oh, I don't usually remember

411
00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:15.303
unless they're especially portentous.
Do you know what that word means?

412
00:43:15.595 --> 00:43:18.723
It means when you dream about
something that's gonna happen.

413
00:43:19.474 --> 00:43:21.977
Like one night, I had a dream

414
00:43:22.144 --> 00:43:26.898
where this crow came and said:

415
00:43:27.065 --> 00:43:29.568
"Your aunt is gonna die."

416
00:43:30.735 --> 00:43:33.989
I was so scared,
I woke up my parents

417
00:43:34.156 --> 00:43:38.410
but they said it was just a dream
and to get back to bed.

418
00:43:38.577 --> 00:43:42.080
But the next morning,
my Aunt Stacy was dead.

419
00:43:42.414 --> 00:43:44.416
That's terrible.

420
00:43:44.583 --> 00:43:49.713
Terrible for her, but think about me,
young boy with that kind of power.

421
00:43:50.255 --> 00:43:55.010
Wasn't three weeks later when the
crow came back to me in a dream

422
00:43:55.177 --> 00:43:59.890
and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."

423
00:44:00.724 --> 00:44:02.767
I didn't know what to do.

424
00:44:03.143 --> 00:44:06.813
I finally told my father, but he said:

425
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:12.819
"Oh, not to worry."
But I could see he was rattled.

426
00:44:12.986 --> 00:44:15.822
The next morning, he wasn't himself.

427
00:44:15.989 --> 00:44:20.619
Kept looking around, waiting for
something to drop on his head.

428
00:44:20.786 --> 00:44:25.874
Because the crow didn't say how it
was gonna happen, just those words:

429
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:28.293
"Your daddy's gonna die."

430
00:44:28.877 --> 00:44:34.800
Well, he left home early
and was gone a long time.

431
00:44:34.966 --> 00:44:37.677
When he finally came back,
he looked terrible

432
00:44:37.844 --> 00:44:41.139
like he was waiting
for the axe to fall all day.

433
00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.934
He said to my mother:

434
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.854
"I've just had the worst day of my life."

435
00:44:48.021 --> 00:44:52.025
"You think you've had a bad day?"
she said.

436
00:44:52.192 --> 00:44:57.322
"This morning, the milkman
dropped dead on the porch."

437
00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:03.662
Because, see, my mother
was banging the milkman.

438
00:45:05.497 --> 00:45:10.168
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, you don't need a picture.

439
00:45:10.335 --> 00:45:14.506
Just look up the word "handsome"
in the dictionary.

440
00:45:14.673 --> 00:45:16.007
Please?

441
00:45:17.676 --> 00:45:19.136
All right.

442
00:45:22.514 --> 00:45:24.599
I have photos of the wedding
to show you.

443
00:45:24.766 --> 00:45:27.185
There is a great one
of you and my father.

444
00:45:33.525 --> 00:45:38.196
I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I've never seen any.

445
00:45:38.363 --> 00:45:41.783
That's because we didn't have
a proper wedding.

446
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:45.370
Your mother-in-law was
never supposed to marry me.

447
00:45:45.537 --> 00:45:49.374
- She was engaged to somebody else.
- I never knew.

448
00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:52.127
Will never told you?

449
00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:55.172
Probably just as well.

450
00:45:55.338 --> 00:45:57.966
He would have told it wrong, anyway.

451
00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:01.344
All the facts, none of the flavour.

452
00:46:01.511 --> 00:46:05.182
Oh. So this is a tall tale.

453
00:46:06.057 --> 00:46:09.519
Well, it's not a short one.

454
00:46:12.063 --> 00:46:16.902
<i>I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

455
00:46:17.068 --> 00:46:19.863
<i>Not knowing what
that would be exactly...

456
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:24.951
<i>I explored every opportunity
that presented itself.

457
00:46:53.814 --> 00:46:58.110
Coco! Coco! There they are.

458
00:46:59.361 --> 00:47:02.781
Ladies and gentlemen!

459
00:47:02.948 --> 00:47:06.701
You may think
you've seen the unusual.

460
00:47:07.536 --> 00:47:11.873
You may think you've seen the bizarre.

461
00:47:13.208 --> 00:47:18.046
But I've travelled
to the five corners of the world

462
00:47:18.421 --> 00:47:24.928
and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this!

463
00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.394
When I met this man

464
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:35.272
he was picking oranges in Florida.

465
00:47:35.439 --> 00:47:39.484
His fellow workers called him
El Penumbra. "The Shadow."

466
00:47:41.445 --> 00:47:43.822
Because when you worked
beside him

467
00:47:44.364 --> 00:47:46.658
he blocked out the daylight!

468
00:47:47.325 --> 00:47:51.413
Not to alarm you, ma'am,
but if this man wanted to

469
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:56.042
he could crush your head
between his toes

470
00:47:56.209 --> 00:47:59.754
like a tiny walnut.
But he won't do it.

471
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:02.507
No. No, ladies and gentlemen

472
00:48:02.674 --> 00:48:04.801
he will not hurt her

473
00:48:05.093 --> 00:48:08.680
because he is our own gentle giant.

474
00:48:10.015 --> 00:48:16.188
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Colossus!

475
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:44.359
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls

476
00:49:44.526 --> 00:49:46.903
thank y'all for coming.

477
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.615
Drive home safely, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

478
00:49:51.116 --> 00:49:54.786
<i>It was on that night
Karl met his destiny.

479
00:49:55.078 --> 00:49:58.457
<i>And I met mine, almost.

480
00:49:58.623 --> 00:50:03.462
<i>They say when you meet
the love of your life, time stops.

481
00:50:03.628 --> 00:50:05.130
<i>And that's true.

482
00:50:50.342 --> 00:50:53.470
<i>What they don't tell you
is that once time starts again...

483
00:50:54.179 --> 00:50:57.974
<i>it moves extra fast to catch up.

484
00:51:30.841 --> 00:51:32.217
What's your name?

485
00:51:33.135 --> 00:51:37.430
- It's Karl.
- Karl.

486
00:51:42.894 --> 00:51:48.442
Tell me, Karl, have you ever heard
the term "involuntary servitude"?

487
00:51:48.608 --> 00:51:51.486
- No.
- "Unconscionable contract"?

488
00:51:53.655 --> 00:51:56.533
- Nope.
- Great.

489
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.743
Here you go.

490
00:51:59.911 --> 00:52:01.580
Here you are.

491
00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:07.586
Mr. Soggybottom,
come down this here

492
00:52:07.752 --> 00:52:10.088
so he can use your back
to sign on it.

493
00:52:22.225 --> 00:52:25.103
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

494
00:52:26.396 --> 00:52:28.315
Hey, kid.

495
00:52:28.482 --> 00:52:31.860
- Your friend just made himself a star.
- Oh, that's great.

496
00:52:34.154 --> 00:52:36.823
- My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
- Good to meet you.

497
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:38.658
Pleased to meet you.

498
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:46.875
What's the matter? I haven't
seen a customer so depressed

499
00:52:47.042 --> 00:52:50.295
since the elephant sat
on that farmer's wife.

500
00:52:51.546 --> 00:52:53.715
"Depressed"?

501
00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.761
See? The big guy likes it.

502
00:52:58.553 --> 00:53:00.639
I just saw the woman I'm gonna marry.

503
00:53:00.806 --> 00:53:03.934
I know it. But I lost her.

504
00:53:05.018 --> 00:53:06.353
Oh, tough break.

505
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.398
Well, most men have to get married
before they lose their wives.

506
00:53:10.565 --> 00:53:15.654
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
looking for her. That or die alone.

507
00:53:16.029 --> 00:53:17.906
Damn, kid.

508
00:53:21.159 --> 00:53:23.495
Let me guess. Real pretty?

509
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.665
Reddish-blondish hair?

510
00:53:28.458 --> 00:53:29.835
Blue dress?

511
00:53:31.169 --> 00:53:32.838
Yeah!

512
00:53:33.004 --> 00:53:36.007
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

513
00:53:36.174 --> 00:53:38.301
Who is she? Where does she live?

514
00:53:38.468 --> 00:53:41.346
Forget it. Don't waste your time.
She's out of your league.

515
00:53:41.513 --> 00:53:45.016
- What? You don't even know me.
- Sure I do.

516
00:53:45.183 --> 00:53:49.646
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but
here in the real world, you got squat.

517
00:53:49.813 --> 00:53:51.731
You don't have a plan or a job.

518
00:53:51.898 --> 00:53:54.359
Nothing except the clothes
on your back.

519
00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.737
Well, I have a whole backpack
full of clothes.

520
00:53:58.864 --> 00:54:01.658
Oh, someone stole my backpack.

521
00:54:02.409 --> 00:54:06.371
You were a big fish in a small pond,
but this here is the ocean

522
00:54:06.538 --> 00:54:09.124
and you're drowning.
Go back to Puddleville.

523
00:54:09.291 --> 00:54:12.711
- You'll be happy there.
- You say I don't have a plan. I do.

524
00:54:12.878 --> 00:54:16.506
I'll find that girl, marry her,
and spend the rest of my life with her.

525
00:54:17.048 --> 00:54:20.760
I don't have a job, but I would
have a job if you gave me one.

526
00:54:20.927 --> 00:54:22.971
And I may not have much

527
00:54:23.138 --> 00:54:26.850
but I have more determination
than any man you're likely to meet.

528
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:32.731
I'm sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Come on, big boy.

529
00:54:33.732 --> 00:54:36.109
Wait. Look, I'll work
night and day for you

530
00:54:36.276 --> 00:54:38.069
and you won't have to pay me.

531
00:54:40.071 --> 00:54:43.074
You just have to tell me who she is.

532
00:54:46.578 --> 00:54:48.580
Every month you work for me

533
00:54:48.747 --> 00:54:52.167
I'll tell you one thing about her.
That's my final offer.

534
00:54:56.087 --> 00:54:58.340
Let's get started.

535
00:55:11.394 --> 00:55:15.398
<i>From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked.

536
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:18.652
<i>I'd go three days
without stopping to eat.

537
00:55:18.819 --> 00:55:21.446
<i>And four days without sleeping.

538
00:55:21.613 --> 00:55:24.491
<i>What kept me going was
the promise of meeting the girl...

539
00:55:24.658 --> 00:55:25.951
<i>who would be my wife.

540
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:36.086
Stick together, that's the way
it's gonna be.

541
00:55:36.253 --> 00:55:40.132
- The way it was, and the way it will be.
- Mr. Calloway, sir?

542
00:55:40.298 --> 00:55:42.092
It's been a month today.

543
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:47.264
This girl, the love of your life

544
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:52.394
her favourite flowers are daffodils.

545
00:55:53.395 --> 00:55:57.774
- So get that stuff...
- Daffodils.

546
00:55:58.483 --> 00:56:00.902
Daffodils.

547
00:56:02.487 --> 00:56:04.739
Daffodils.

548
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:12.372
<i>True to his word...

549
00:56:12.539 --> 00:56:15.333
<i>every month Amos would tell me
something new...

550
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.836
<i>about the woman of my dreams.

551
00:56:18.003 --> 00:56:20.964
Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves.

552
00:56:21.131 --> 00:56:22.632
She's going to college.

553
00:56:23.008 --> 00:56:27.304
College. She's going to college.

554
00:56:37.856 --> 00:56:39.316
She likes music.

555
00:56:40.025 --> 00:56:43.779
Music. She likes music.

556
00:56:48.033 --> 00:56:52.204
<i>Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

557
00:56:52.704 --> 00:56:55.373
<i>but not her name,
and not where to find her.

558
00:56:55.999 --> 00:57:00.754
<i>That time had come.
I couldn't wait any longer.

559
00:57:12.057 --> 00:57:14.351
Mr. Calloway?

560
00:57:16.394 --> 00:57:19.689
It's Edward Bloom.
I need to talk to you.

561
00:57:23.944 --> 00:57:26.363
Mr. Calloway?

562
00:58:00.147 --> 00:58:01.523
No. Wait!

563
00:58:19.624 --> 00:58:24.254
<i>That night, I discovered that most
things you consider evil or wicked...

564
00:58:24.421 --> 00:58:28.300
<i>are simply lonely and lacking
in social niceties.

565
00:59:02.709 --> 00:59:04.836
Didn't kill anything, did I?

566
00:59:05.796 --> 00:59:10.258
A few rabbits. But I think one of them
was already dead.

567
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:16.515
That would explain the indigestion.

568
00:59:23.605 --> 00:59:25.607
Thank you.

569
00:59:27.609 --> 00:59:29.778
I was wrong about you, kid.

570
00:59:29.945 --> 00:59:33.365
You may not have much,
but what you got, you got a lot of.

571
00:59:33.698 --> 00:59:36.159
You could get any girl.

572
00:59:36.326 --> 00:59:38.328
There's only one I want.

573
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:44.376
Her name

574
00:59:47.712 --> 00:59:49.881
is Sandra Templeton.

575
00:59:51.967 --> 00:59:54.636
She goes to Auburn.

576
00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:59.391
Semester's almost over,
so you better hurry.

577
00:59:59.558 --> 01:00:01.309
Thank you. Thank you.

578
01:00:01.893 --> 01:00:04.396
- Good luck, kid!
- Thank you, sir!

579
01:00:16.908 --> 01:00:19.536
- Bye, now.
- Bye, Edward.

580
01:00:20.912 --> 01:00:24.332
<i>After saying my goodbyes,
I hopped three trains...

581
01:00:24.499 --> 01:00:27.919
<i>to get to Auburn that afternoon.

582
01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:06.750
You don't know me,
but my name is Edward Bloom

583
01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:08.293
and I love you.

584
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.924
I've spent the last three years
working to find out who you are.

585
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:18.386
I've been shot, stabbed, and trampled
a few times. I broke my ribs twice.

586
01:01:18.845 --> 01:01:21.890
But it's all been worth it
to see you here now

587
01:01:22.057 --> 01:01:25.018
and to finally get to talk to you.

588
01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:27.562
Because I'm destined to marry you.

589
01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:33.777
I knew it when I saw you at the circus,
and I know it now more than ever.

590
01:01:35.946 --> 01:01:39.324
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize to me.

591
01:01:39.491 --> 01:01:41.827
I'm the luckiest person
you'll find today.

592
01:01:41.993 --> 01:01:45.163
No, I'm sorry I'm engaged
to be married.

593
01:01:52.337 --> 01:01:55.507
But you're wrong. I do know you.

594
01:01:55.674 --> 01:01:57.634
At least by reputation.

595
01:01:58.552 --> 01:02:00.971
Edward Bloom from Ashton.

596
01:02:01.513 --> 01:02:05.851
See, I'm actually engaged
to a boy from Ashton. Don Price.

597
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.104
He was a few years older than you.

598
01:02:19.739 --> 01:02:21.616
Well...

599
01:02:23.743 --> 01:02:25.287
Congratulations.

600
01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:31.042
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

601
01:02:36.006 --> 01:02:39.092
Stop it! It's not funny.

602
01:02:39.801 --> 01:02:42.262
That poor boy.

603
01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:46.057
<i>Fate has a cruel way
of circling around on you.

604
01:02:46.224 --> 01:02:48.310
<i>After all this work to leave Ashton...

605
01:02:48.477 --> 01:02:53.940
<i>the girl I love was now engaged
to one of its biggest jerks.

606
01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:56.359
<i>There's a time when a man
needs to fight...

607
01:02:56.526 --> 01:02:59.988
<i>and a time when he needs to accept
that his destiny's lost...

608
01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:04.242
<i>the ship has sailed,
and that only a fool will continue.

609
01:03:04.409 --> 01:03:07.746
<i>Truth is, I've always been a fool.

610
01:03:08.747 --> 01:03:13.710
Sandra Templeton, I love you,
and I will marry you!

611
01:03:18.048 --> 01:03:21.426
So as you can see, if we apply
these rules to our everyday life

612
01:03:22.093 --> 01:03:24.846
supply and demand
makes much more sense.

613
01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:29.059
Take a look at the next graph, and the
import of this will be even stronger...

614
01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:40.779
...for three hours.

615
01:03:40.946 --> 01:03:42.823
Look!

616
01:04:13.353 --> 01:04:16.648
- Daffodils!
- They're your favourite flower.

617
01:04:16.815 --> 01:04:18.233
How did you get so many?

618
01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:21.111
I called everywhere in five states.

619
01:04:21.278 --> 01:04:24.239
I told them it was the only way
to get my wife to marry me.

620
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:28.160
You don't even know me.

621
01:04:28.785 --> 01:04:31.246
I have the rest of my life to find out.

622
01:04:32.372 --> 01:04:34.040
Sandra!

623
01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:38.503
It's Don. Promise you won't hurt him.

624
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:41.590
If that's what you want, I swear to it.

625
01:04:42.007 --> 01:04:44.468
- Bloom?
- Don.

626
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:49.598
What the hell are you doing?
This is my girl. Mine!

627
01:04:49.765 --> 01:04:52.350
I wasn't aware
that she belonged to anyone.

628
01:04:55.645 --> 01:04:58.648
What's the matter?
Are you too scared to fight back?

629
01:04:58.815 --> 01:05:00.484
I promised I wouldn't.

630
01:05:01.693 --> 01:05:03.987
Stop it!

631
01:05:04.488 --> 01:05:05.781
Don, stop!

632
01:05:05.947 --> 01:05:11.369
<i>While I took the beating of a lifetime,
Don Price was ultimately defeated.

633
01:05:11.536 --> 01:05:16.291
<i>All the physical activity had worsened
a congenital valve defect.

634
01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:18.627
<i>Put simply, his heart
wasn't strong enough.

635
01:05:31.223 --> 01:05:33.683
Don! I will never marry you.

636
01:05:34.559 --> 01:05:37.270
What?
You mean, you love this guy?

637
01:05:37.479 --> 01:05:40.607
He's almost a stranger,
and I prefer him to you.

638
01:06:08.802 --> 01:06:14.182
<i>As it turned out, Sandra was able to
keep her same date at the chapel.

639
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:17.561
<i>Only the groom had changed.

640
01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.566
I thought you said you didn't
have a church wedding.

641
01:06:22.732 --> 01:06:25.819
We were all set to,
but there was a complication.

642
01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:33.410
Is it the medicine
that's making you thirsty?

643
01:06:33.994 --> 01:06:37.539
Truth is,
I've been thirsty my whole life.

644
01:06:38.665 --> 01:06:41.209
Never really known why.

645
01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:44.629
There was a time when I was 11...

646
01:06:44.796 --> 01:06:46.756
You were talking about your wedding.

647
01:06:46.923 --> 01:06:50.844
I didn't forget.
I was just working on a tangent.

648
01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:54.681
You see, most men, they'll tell you
a story straight through.

649
01:06:54.848 --> 01:06:58.602
It won't be complicated,
but it won't be interesting, either.

650
01:06:59.186 --> 01:07:00.687
I like your stories.

651
01:07:00.729 --> 01:07:02.689
And I like you.

652
01:07:02.731 --> 01:07:07.152
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

653
01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:10.489
So after three years,
there was a lot of undelivered mail.

654
01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:14.159
During the four weeks
I was in the hospital

655
01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:16.995
the postmaster
finally caught up with me.

656
01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:20.665
And it seems that while my heart
belonged to Sandra

657
01:07:20.832 --> 01:07:26.505
the rest of my body belonged
to the U.S . government.

658
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.150
A hitch in the Army was up to
three years at that point

659
01:07:47.317 --> 01:07:50.362
and having waited three years
just to meet Sandra

660
01:07:50.529 --> 01:07:54.491
I knew I couldn't survive
being away from her that long.

661
01:07:54.658 --> 01:07:57.786
So I took every hazardous
assignment I could find

662
01:07:57.953 --> 01:08:02.290
with the hope of getting
my time down to less than a year.

663
01:08:02.457 --> 01:08:05.001
Go! Go!

664
01:08:07.546 --> 01:08:09.631
<i>When I was offered
a secret mission...

665
01:08:09.798 --> 01:08:13.760
<i>to steal the plans for
the Wong Kai Tang power plant...

666
01:08:13.927 --> 01:08:17.055
<i>I jumped at the chance
to serve my country.

667
01:08:20.142 --> 01:08:22.727
Go! Go!

668
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:20.512
Any of you got needs?

669
01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:08.495
How could you miss your cue?

670
01:12:08.662 --> 01:12:12.624
You make me look like a fool
out there alone.

671
01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:14.501
You weren't alone!

672
01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:17.879
Who the hell are you?

673
01:12:18.046 --> 01:12:19.881
I'm not going to hurt you.

674
01:12:20.006 --> 01:12:21.049
Damn right you're not.

675
01:12:21.174 --> 01:12:22.217
GU ARD!

676
01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:25.720
Tell your men not to bother us!

677
01:12:25.887 --> 01:12:27.180
And close that curtain!

678
01:12:29.933 --> 01:12:32.060
Please, I need your help.

679
01:12:32.686 --> 01:12:35.188
What makes you think we'll help you?

680
01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:48.910
<i>Over the next hour, I described
my love for Sandra K. Templeton...

681
01:12:49.077 --> 01:12:51.997
<i>and the ordeal that brought me
before them.

682
01:12:52.164 --> 01:12:55.500
<i>As it had always been,
this love was my salvation.

683
01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:57.836
<i>It was destined to be.

684
01:12:58.003 --> 01:13:01.173
<i>We put together an elaborate
plan for escape...

685
01:13:01.339 --> 01:13:03.592
<i>involving a whaling ship
to Russia

686
01:13:03.758 --> 01:13:07.846
a barge to Cuba,
and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.

687
01:13:08.013 --> 01:13:10.515
<i>We all knew it would be dangerous.

688
01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:14.186
And what are we supposed to do
when we get to America?

689
01:13:14.978 --> 01:13:16.271
I can get you bookings.

690
01:13:16.438 --> 01:13:19.191
I know the biggest man
in show business.

691
01:13:20.317 --> 01:13:21.359
Bob Hope?!

692
01:13:21.651 --> 01:13:22.694
Bigger.

693
01:13:26.448 --> 01:13:27.491
Ready?

694
01:13:30.869 --> 01:13:34.748
<i>And so the twins and I
began our arduous journey...

695
01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:36.875
<i>halfway around the world.

696
01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:41.379
<i>Unfortunately, there was no way
to send a message back to America.

697
01:13:41.546 --> 01:13:45.550
<i>And so it was no surprise
that the Army believed I was dead.

698
01:14:01.817 --> 01:14:04.361
No, God!

699
01:14:05.987 --> 01:14:10.367
<i>After four months, Sandra had gotten
over the worst of the nightmares.

700
01:14:10.534 --> 01:14:14.955
<i>When the phone rang, she didn't think
it was somehow me calling her.

701
01:14:15.122 --> 01:14:19.960
<i>When a car drove past, she didn't
get up to check out the window.

702
01:14:55.036 --> 01:14:58.123
I talked with your father last night.

703
01:15:01.626 --> 01:15:04.629
You never told me
how your parents met.

704
01:15:04.796 --> 01:15:06.631
They met at Auburn.

705
01:15:06.798 --> 01:15:10.635
What about the details?
How they fell in love.

706
01:15:10.802 --> 01:15:12.763
The circus. The war.

707
01:15:12.929 --> 01:15:14.806
You never told me any of that.

708
01:15:14.973 --> 01:15:17.142
That's because most of it
never happened.

709
01:15:18.977 --> 01:15:21.229
But it's romantic.

710
01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:27.194
- What?
- What, I know better

711
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.530
than to argue romance
with a French woman.

712
01:15:32.282 --> 01:15:34.284
Do you love your father?

713
01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:38.038
Everyone loves my father.
He's a very likable guy.

714
01:15:39.414 --> 01:15:40.999
Do you love him?

715
01:15:46.129 --> 01:15:48.131
You have to understand.

716
01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:52.052
When I was growing up,
he was gone more than he was there.

717
01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:56.181
And I started thinking maybe he's got
this second life somewhere else.

718
01:15:57.099 --> 01:15:59.851
Another family, another house.

719
01:16:00.018 --> 01:16:03.313
And he leaves us
and goes to them.

720
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.107
Or, or...

721
01:16:07.526 --> 01:16:11.613
Or maybe there is no second family.
Maybe he never wanted a family.

722
01:16:12.656 --> 01:16:17.244
Whatever it is, he likes his second life
better and he tells his stories

723
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.913
because he can't stand
this boring place.

724
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.208
- But it's not true.
- Well, what's true?

725
01:16:25.252 --> 01:16:28.046
He's never told me
a single true thing.

726
01:16:30.006 --> 01:16:31.550
Look, hey...

727
01:16:32.926 --> 01:16:35.720
I know why you like him.

728
01:16:35.887 --> 01:16:38.682
I know why everyone likes him.

729
01:16:39.808 --> 01:16:43.103
But I need you to tell me
that I'm not crazy.

730
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:46.189
Oh, you're not.

731
01:16:48.191 --> 01:16:50.902
And I think you should talk to him.

732
01:16:56.074 --> 01:16:59.244
<i>Larry Puck ett's Chevrolet
lets the customer do the talking.

733
01:16:59.411 --> 01:17:03.081
<i>Larry Puckett's GM-certified vehicles
are under factory warranty.

734
01:17:03.248 --> 01:17:07.294
<i>And you can save up to 40 percent
off the original MSRP.

735
01:17:07.461 --> 01:17:10.172
- Did I ever tell you about...?
- Yes.

736
01:17:11.423 --> 01:17:14.843
The maple tree and the Buick?
We've heard it.

737
01:17:17.262 --> 01:17:20.766
I know someone who hasn't.

738
01:17:20.932 --> 01:17:24.603
- The...
- Tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup.

739
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:28.273
Which attracted the flies,
which got stuck to it

740
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.526
and flew off with the whole car.

741
01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:39.493
But the real story
is how I got the car.

742
01:17:39.659 --> 01:17:41.369
- You see...
- Dad?

743
01:17:41.536 --> 01:17:42.996
Son.

744
01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:45.207
Can we talk?

745
01:17:47.626 --> 01:17:50.086
I think I'll get started
on these dishes.

746
01:17:50.253 --> 01:17:52.464
I'll help you.

747
01:18:07.979 --> 01:18:11.316
- You know about icebergs, Dad?
- Do I?

748
01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:13.944
I saw an iceberg once.

749
01:18:14.111 --> 01:18:17.405
They were hauling it down to Texas
for drinking water.

750
01:18:17.572 --> 01:18:21.660
They didn't count on there being
an elephant frozen inside.

751
01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:24.621
- The woolly kind. A mammoth.
- Dad!

752
01:18:24.788 --> 01:18:26.748
What?

753
01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:30.752
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

754
01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:33.630
Well, you shouldn't have started
with a question

755
01:18:33.797 --> 01:18:36.091
because people
want to answer questions.

756
01:18:36.258 --> 01:18:39.845
You should've started with,
"The thing about icebergs is..."

757
01:18:40.011 --> 01:18:43.473
Okay, okay. The thing about
icebergs is you only see 10 percent.

758
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.018
The other 90 percent is below
the water where you can't see it.

759
01:18:47.185 --> 01:18:49.271
And that's

760
01:18:49.438 --> 01:18:52.190
what it is with you, Dad.

761
01:18:52.357 --> 01:18:55.110
I am only seeing this little bit

762
01:18:55.277 --> 01:18:57.112
that sticks above the water.

763
01:18:57.279 --> 01:19:00.449
Oh, you're only seeing down
to my nose? My chin? My...

764
01:19:00.615 --> 01:19:03.535
Dad, I have no idea who you are

765
01:19:03.702 --> 01:19:06.955
because you've never told me
a single fact.

766
01:19:07.122 --> 01:19:11.376
I've told you a thousand facts, Will.
That's what I do, I tell stories!

767
01:19:11.543 --> 01:19:14.796
You tell... lies, Dad.

768
01:19:14.963 --> 01:19:16.298
You tell amusing lies.

769
01:19:16.465 --> 01:19:19.551
Stories are what you tell
a 5-year-old at bedtime.

770
01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:22.596
They're not elaborate mythologies
that you maintain

771
01:19:22.763 --> 01:19:25.223
when your son is 10 and 15
and 20 and 30.

772
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:28.226
And I believed you.

773
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.440
I believed your stories
so much longer than I should have.

774
01:19:33.607 --> 01:19:36.735
Then when I realized
everything you said was impossible

775
01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:39.112
I felt like a fool
to have trusted you.

776
01:19:39.279 --> 01:19:41.573
You're like Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny.

777
01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.575
Just as charming and just as fake.

778
01:19:43.742 --> 01:19:45.952
You think I'm fake.

779
01:19:47.412 --> 01:19:51.583
Only on the surface, Dad.
But it's all I've ever seen.

780
01:19:53.335 --> 01:19:55.003
Look.

781
01:19:56.588 --> 01:19:59.007
I'm about to have

782
01:19:59.508 --> 01:20:00.759
a kid of my own.

783
01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:03.595
It would kill me
if he went through his whole life

784
01:20:03.762 --> 01:20:05.847
never understanding me.

785
01:20:06.014 --> 01:20:08.433
It would kill you, huh?

786
01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:13.939
What do you want, Will?
Who do you want me to be?

787
01:20:14.106 --> 01:20:15.774
Just yourself.

788
01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:19.778
Good, bad, everything.
Just show me who you are for once.

789
01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:23.031
I've been nothing but myself
since the day I was born.

790
01:20:23.198 --> 01:20:27.744
And if you can't see that,
it's your failing, not mine!

791
01:20:59.067 --> 01:21:03.655
Your father decided
that he needed to have an office

792
01:21:03.822 --> 01:21:06.908
and, of course, it wouldn't do
to have it in the house.

793
01:21:07.075 --> 01:21:08.618
So...

794
01:21:10.245 --> 01:21:13.999
You'll know better than me
what's important.

795
01:21:25.302 --> 01:21:27.429
What is it?

796
01:21:28.847 --> 01:21:30.849
It was during the war.

797
01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:34.895
Your father went missing.
They thought he was dead.

798
01:21:36.104 --> 01:21:38.523
Oh, that really happened?

799
01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:42.444
Not everything your father says
is a complete fabrication.

800
01:21:43.779 --> 01:21:46.823
I think I'll go check on him.

801
01:21:48.992 --> 01:21:51.661
I need to lie down for a bit.

802
01:21:51.828 --> 01:21:54.456
Okay, go.

803
01:22:09.221 --> 01:22:14.017
<i>After the war, the sons of Alabama
returned home, looking for work.

804
01:22:14.184 --> 01:22:15.936
<i>Each had the advantage over me.

805
01:22:16.103 --> 01:22:19.689
<i>They were alive,
while I was officially deceased.

806
01:22:19.856 --> 01:22:21.608
<i>With my prospects few...

807
01:22:21.775 --> 01:22:25.362
<i>I took a job as a travelling salesman.
It suited me.

808
01:22:25.737 --> 01:22:28.907
<i>If there was one thing
you can say about Edward Bloom...

809
01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:31.284
<i>it's that I am a social person.

810
01:22:31.993 --> 01:22:35.413
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

811
01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:38.667
<i>I could be gone
for weeks at a time.

812
01:22:38.834 --> 01:22:41.753
<i>But every other Friday,
I put all the money I made...

813
01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.590
<i>into an account set aside
for a proper house...

814
01:22:45.757 --> 01:22:47.926
<i>with a white picket fence.

815
01:22:53.723 --> 01:22:57.269
I'd like a moment of your time
to tell you about my new product

816
01:22:57.436 --> 01:22:59.771
the Handi-matic.

817
01:23:15.245 --> 01:23:18.540
<i>A few years later, I added
other products and other cities...

818
01:23:18.707 --> 01:23:22.294
<i>until my territory stretched from
the coast to western Texas.

819
01:23:47.152 --> 01:23:48.653
Edward?

820
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.155
Edward Bloom!

821
01:23:50.614 --> 01:23:52.240
It's me, Norther Winslow.

822
01:23:52.407 --> 01:23:54.284
I don't believe it.

823
01:23:54.451 --> 01:23:58.747
<i>I was astonished to see the greatest
poet of both Ashton and Spectre...

824
01:23:58.914 --> 01:24:00.832
<i>all the way out in Texas.

825
01:24:00.999 --> 01:24:04.836
I want you to know, when you left
Spectre, it opened my eyes.

826
01:24:05.003 --> 01:24:08.673
There was a whole life out there
that I was not living.

827
01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.342
So I travelled.

828
01:24:10.509 --> 01:24:13.470
I saw France, Africa,
half of South America.

829
01:24:13.845 --> 01:24:16.515
Every day, a new adventure.
That's my motto.

830
01:24:16.681 --> 01:24:18.850
That's great, Norther.
I'm happy for you.

831
01:24:19.017 --> 01:24:21.269
What are you doing now?

832
01:24:22.354 --> 01:24:24.022
I'm robbing this place.

833
01:24:28.026 --> 01:24:30.028
All right, everybody down!

834
01:24:31.488 --> 01:24:34.741
Hey!
Just slide that over.

835
01:24:40.956 --> 01:24:43.708
- Would you mind grabbing that?
- What?

836
01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:45.669
The gun.

837
01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:49.589
I'm gonna be cleaning out
the cash drawers

838
01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:53.969
and my associate here
is gonna handle the vault.

839
01:24:59.975 --> 01:25:03.437
All right, you!
You help my friend, okay?

840
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:05.897
Let's go!

841
01:25:25.584 --> 01:25:27.502
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I am.

842
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:30.797
I really just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

843
01:25:30.964 --> 01:25:32.924
It's not that.

844
01:25:33.884 --> 01:25:35.802
It's just...

845
01:25:41.266 --> 01:25:42.893
There's no money.

846
01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:47.564
We're completely bankrupt.
Don't tell anybody.

847
01:25:47.731 --> 01:25:51.735
<i>It turned out that the Savings & Loan
had already been robbed...

848
01:25:51.902 --> 01:25:56.406
<i>not by armed bandits, but
by speculators in Texas real estate.

849
01:25:56.573 --> 01:25:58.575
All right, let's go!

850
01:26:09.753 --> 01:26:11.797
Norther!

851
01:26:31.399 --> 01:26:34.152
Yeah! There's gotta be
close to $400 here!

852
01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:36.822
And that's just from the drawers.

853
01:26:36.988 --> 01:26:39.491
Let's see what you got
from the vault.

854
01:26:49.376 --> 01:26:52.003
This is it? The whole vault?

855
01:26:52.170 --> 01:26:54.506
I'm afraid so.

856
01:26:57.259 --> 01:26:59.177
It's got your deposit slip on it.

857
01:26:59.344 --> 01:27:02.222
Well, I just didn't want you
leaving empty-handed.

858
01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:06.184
There's something you should know.
The reason they don't have money...

859
01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:09.604
<i>I told Norther about
the vagaries of Texas oil money...

860
01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:12.649
<i>and its effect on real-estate prices...

861
01:27:12.816 --> 01:27:15.986
<i>and how lax enforcement
of fiduciary process...

862
01:27:16.153 --> 01:27:19.948
<i>had made savings and loans
particularly vulnerable.

863
01:27:20.115 --> 01:27:24.911
<i>Hearing this news,
Norther was left with one conclusionl

864
01:27:25.078 --> 01:27:28.290
I should go to Wall Street.
That's where all the money is.

865
01:27:28.457 --> 01:27:32.043
<i>I knew then that while my days
as a criminal were over...

866
01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:33.503
Thanks for the hand!

867
01:27:33.670 --> 01:27:35.672
<i>Norther's were just beginning.

868
01:27:35.839 --> 01:27:38.258
<i>When Norther made
his first million dollars...

869
01:27:38.425 --> 01:27:40.719
<i>he sent me a check for 10, 000.

870
01:27:40.886 --> 01:27:44.973
<i>I protested, but he said it was my fee
as his career advisor.

871
01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:48.310
<i>It was enough to buy my wife
a proper house...

872
01:27:48.477 --> 01:27:50.562
<i>with a white picket fence.

873
01:27:50.729 --> 01:27:54.900
<i>And for that, it was all the riches
a man could ever want.

874
01:28:28.767 --> 01:28:30.727
I was drying out.

875
01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:34.397
I see.

876
01:28:36.566 --> 01:28:40.779
I think we ought to get you
a plant mister

877
01:28:40.946 --> 01:28:43.740
so we can just spray you
like a fern.

878
01:29:09.641 --> 01:29:12.144
Come, now.

879
01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:19.860
I don't think I'll ever dry out.

880
01:30:18.043 --> 01:30:21.088
You carry on. I'll see...

881
01:30:25.759 --> 01:30:27.552
Hello.

882
01:30:28.136 --> 01:30:32.057
- Are you Jennifer Hill?
- I am.

883
01:30:32.224 --> 01:30:34.392
And you're Will.

884
01:30:34.559 --> 01:30:37.562
I've seen a picture of you.
That's how I recognize you.

885
01:30:40.232 --> 01:30:42.901
Listen, Kenny,
why don't we skip the lesson today?

886
01:30:43.068 --> 01:30:45.403
We can go again next week.

887
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:47.572
Do I have to give it back to my mom?

888
01:30:47.739 --> 01:30:50.325
Well, I won't tell her if you won't.

889
01:31:01.753 --> 01:31:03.255
How did you know my father?

890
01:31:03.630 --> 01:31:05.715
Well, this was on his sales route

891
01:31:05.882 --> 01:31:09.928
so he was through here all the time,
and everyone in town knew him.

892
01:31:10.095 --> 01:31:12.180
Were you having an affair?

893
01:31:14.599 --> 01:31:17.018
Wow. Wow, you just said it.

894
01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:21.440
I was expecting to dance
around this for another half-hour.

895
01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:26.278
I've seen him with women.
He flirts. He always has.

896
01:31:26.445 --> 01:31:30.615
And on some level,
I just presumed that he was

897
01:31:30.782 --> 01:31:34.286
cheating on my mom.
I just never had proof.

898
01:31:36.955 --> 01:31:38.874
Well, can I ask you a question?

899
01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.793
If you found this deed,
why didn't you just ask Eddie?

900
01:31:42.919 --> 01:31:45.255
Because he's dying.

901
01:31:53.972 --> 01:31:58.643
Look, I don't know how much
you want to know about any of this.

902
01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:00.937
You have one image of your father

903
01:32:01.104 --> 01:32:03.356
and it'd be wrong of me
to change it

904
01:32:03.523 --> 01:32:05.484
especially this late in the game.

905
01:32:05.734 --> 01:32:08.111
My father talked about things
he never did

906
01:32:08.278 --> 01:32:11.656
and I'm sure he did a lot of things
that he never talked about.

907
01:32:11.823 --> 01:32:13.825
I'm just trying to reconcile the two.

908
01:32:17.287 --> 01:32:20.373
The first thing
you have to understand

909
01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:23.502
is that your father
never meant to end up here.

910
01:32:24.085 --> 01:32:25.462
Yet he did.

911
01:32:25.670 --> 01:32:27.339
Twice.

912
01:32:27.881 --> 01:32:30.383
The first time, he was early.

913
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:32.803
The second time, he was late.

914
01:32:34.888 --> 01:32:38.809
<i>Those days, your father was working
for himself.

915
01:32:38.975 --> 01:32:41.895
<i>If there's one thing you could
say about Edward Bloom

916
01:32:42.062 --> 01:32:47.067
it's that he was a social person,
and people took a liking to him.

917
01:32:47.234 --> 01:32:50.487
<i>One night, he was returning
from three weeks on the road...

918
01:32:50.654 --> 01:32:54.366
<i>when he hit a thunderstorm
unlike any in his life.

919
01:34:42.641 --> 01:34:45.185
<i>Fate has a way of circling back
on a man

920
01:34:45.352 --> 01:34:47.479
and taking him by surprise.

921
01:34:52.192 --> 01:34:55.862
<i>A man sees things differently
at different times in his life.

922
01:34:56.029 --> 01:34:59.991
<i>This town didn't seem the same
now that he was older.

923
01:35:01.159 --> 01:35:04.704
<i>A new road had brought
the outside world to Spectre...

924
01:35:04.871 --> 01:35:07.999
<i>and with it, banks, liens and debt.

925
01:35:08.166 --> 01:35:13.004
<i>Almost everywhere you look ed,
people were bankrupt.

926
01:35:14.297 --> 01:35:17.676
The auction today
is for the town of Spectre.

927
01:35:17.843 --> 01:35:20.554
- The opening bid will be $10,000.
- So Edward Bloom

928
01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:23.348
decided to buy the town.
- 50,000.

929
01:35:27.519 --> 01:35:30.730
- I couldn't believe my eyes...
- He was never a wealthy man...

930
01:35:30.897 --> 01:35:36.069
<i>but he had made other men rich,
and now he asked for their favours.

931
01:35:37.988 --> 01:35:41.032
- I'm trying to save...
- Most of them hadn't seen Spectre.

932
01:35:41.199 --> 01:35:44.411
<i>They only had Edward's words
to describe it.

933
01:35:44.578 --> 01:35:47.873
<i>That's all he needed.
He sold them on the dream.

934
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:50.792
<i>So first he bought the farms.

935
01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:54.880
<i>Then he bought the houses.
And then he bought the stores.

936
01:35:55.464 --> 01:36:00.552
<i>Whatever he bought, the people were
not asked to leave or pay rent.

937
01:36:00.719 --> 01:36:03.638
<i>They were just asked to keep
doing as they were doing.

938
01:36:04.014 --> 01:36:08.059
<i>In that way, he could make sure
the town would never die.

939
01:36:10.479 --> 01:36:15.734
<i>Within six months, his trust had
purchased the entire town.

940
01:36:15.901 --> 01:36:18.570
<i>With one exception.

941
01:36:42.803 --> 01:36:45.889
You must be Edward Bloom.

942
01:36:46.056 --> 01:36:47.349
How do you know?

943
01:36:47.933 --> 01:36:50.644
No one would come out here
unless they had business.

944
01:36:50.852 --> 01:36:53.855
And no one would have business
with me except for you.

945
01:36:54.022 --> 01:36:56.399
You're buying the town.

946
01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:00.946
Apparently I overlooked this one
piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.

947
01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:06.451
In order for the town to be preserved,
the trust must own it, in its entirety.

948
01:37:06.618 --> 01:37:07.953
And so I've heard.

949
01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:11.623
I'll offer you more than it's worth.
And you won't have to move.

950
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:15.210
Nothing will change except the name
on the deed, you have my word.

951
01:37:15.377 --> 01:37:18.046
Now, let me get this straight.

952
01:37:18.213 --> 01:37:20.882
You buy the swamp from me,
but I'll stay in it?

953
01:37:21.049 --> 01:37:23.718
You'll own the house,
but it'll still be mine?

954
01:37:23.885 --> 01:37:27.889
I'll be here, and you'll come and go as
you please to one place or another.

955
01:37:28.056 --> 01:37:30.016
Do I have that right?

956
01:37:30.183 --> 01:37:32.811
In so many words, yes.

957
01:37:33.645 --> 01:37:35.647
Yeah, then I don't think so,
Mr. Bloom.

958
01:37:36.314 --> 01:37:39.317
If nothing's gonna change,
I'd just as soon it not change

959
01:37:39.484 --> 01:37:42.487
in the way things haven't been
changing all this time.

960
01:37:43.697 --> 01:37:48.493
It's not like you'll lose anything.
You can ask anyone in town.

961
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:52.372
Why are you buying this land,
Mr. Bloom?

962
01:37:52.539 --> 01:37:54.124
Some sort of midlife crisis?

963
01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:57.669
lnstead of buying a convertible,
you buy a town?

964
01:37:58.128 --> 01:38:00.297
Helping people makes me happy.

965
01:38:01.006 --> 01:38:04.176
I'm not convinced
you should be happy.

966
01:38:04.342 --> 01:38:08.305
- I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
- No.

967
01:38:08.472 --> 01:38:10.348
You did exactly what you promised.

968
01:38:11.016 --> 01:38:15.645
You came back.
I was just expecting you sooner.

969
01:38:23.195 --> 01:38:24.780
You're Beamen's daughter.

970
01:38:26.573 --> 01:38:29.326
Your name's different.
Did you get married?

971
01:38:30.035 --> 01:38:35.123
I was 18. He was 28.
Turns out that was a big difference.

972
01:38:44.716 --> 01:38:48.011
I won't be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.

973
01:38:48.887 --> 01:38:50.639
I see.

974
01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:54.059
Well, thank you for your time.

975
01:39:05.278 --> 01:39:08.406
- It's stuck.
- Yeah.

976
01:39:18.708 --> 01:39:21.753
- Oh, I'm so sorry! I...
- It's okay. Just leave it.

977
01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.423
- No, I'll...
- Please! Just go.

978
01:39:25.966 --> 01:39:28.552
- But...
- Go.

979
01:39:30.846 --> 01:39:35.600
<i>Most men in that situation would
accept their failure and move on.

980
01:39:35.767 --> 01:39:38.854
<i>But Edward was not like most men.

981
01:39:48.196 --> 01:39:49.614
Hold!

982
01:39:53.076 --> 01:39:55.912
They both had completely
different characters but

983
01:39:56.079 --> 01:39:58.790
well, just one pair of legs.

984
01:40:09.134 --> 01:40:12.679
<i>As the months passed, he found
more and more things to fix...

985
01:40:12.846 --> 01:40:16.767
<i>until the shack no longer
resembled itself.

986
01:40:32.991 --> 01:40:36.995
Of course, the best part
was coming up with the new material.

987
01:40:37.788 --> 01:40:40.248
By the time the twins and I
had got to Havana

988
01:40:40.415 --> 01:40:46.004
we'd worked out a new routine,
using only a ukulele and a harmonica.

989
01:41:05.315 --> 01:41:08.860
- Well...
- You could leave it there.

990
01:41:26.378 --> 01:41:28.004
No.

991
01:41:38.056 --> 01:41:40.016
Now, don't.

992
01:41:40.183 --> 01:41:45.355
Don't be embarrassed. I should never
have let you think that...

993
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:48.984
I'm in love with my wife.

994
01:41:49.985 --> 01:41:51.987
Yeah, I know.

995
01:41:52.154 --> 01:41:55.282
And from the first day I saw her
until the day I die

996
01:41:55.449 --> 01:41:57.534
she's the only one.

997
01:41:58.243 --> 01:42:00.203
Lucky girl.

998
01:42:01.246 --> 01:42:04.166
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

999
01:42:12.090 --> 01:42:14.384
Wait! Edward.

1000
01:42:55.967 --> 01:42:58.845
<i>One day, Edward Bloom left...

1001
01:42:59.012 --> 01:43:02.849
<i>and never returned
to the town he'd saved.

1002
01:43:15.403 --> 01:43:17.239
<i>As for the girl...

1003
01:43:17.405 --> 01:43:20.117
<i>the common belief
was that she'd become a witch...

1004
01:43:20.283 --> 01:43:22.661
<i>and crazy at that.

1005
01:43:24.121 --> 01:43:27.582
<i>She became something
of a legend herself.

1006
01:43:28.834 --> 01:43:33.255
<i>And the story ended where it began.

1007
01:43:34.381 --> 01:43:37.300
Logically, you couldn't be
the witch, because she was

1008
01:43:37.467 --> 01:43:38.760
old when he was young.

1009
01:43:39.052 --> 01:43:42.180
Well, it's logical if you think
like your father.

1010
01:43:43.181 --> 01:43:47.018
See, to him there's only
two women:

1011
01:43:47.185 --> 01:43:48.812
Your mother

1012
01:43:48.979 --> 01:43:50.355
and everyone else.

1013
01:43:50.605 --> 01:43:52.524
And one day

1014
01:43:52.691 --> 01:43:57.154
I realized I was in love with a man
who could never love me back.

1015
01:43:58.196 --> 01:44:00.365
I was living in a fairy tale.

1016
01:44:01.491 --> 01:44:03.618
I'm not sure I should've told you
any of this.

1017
01:44:03.994 --> 01:44:06.538
No, no, no, I wanted to know. I'm...

1018
01:44:06.705 --> 01:44:08.165
I'm glad I know.

1019
01:44:08.874 --> 01:44:12.210
I wanted to be as important to him
as you were.

1020
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:14.504
And I'm...

1021
01:44:14.963 --> 01:44:16.381
I was never gonna be.

1022
01:44:19.342 --> 01:44:21.511
I was make-believe.

1023
01:44:22.971 --> 01:44:27.350
And his other life, you...

1024
01:44:28.185 --> 01:44:29.728
You were real.

1025
01:44:54.044 --> 01:44:55.629
Mom?

1026
01:44:56.671 --> 01:44:58.507
Josephine?

1027
01:45:00.342 --> 01:45:02.219
Josephine?

1028
01:45:15.857 --> 01:45:17.943
Will!

1029
01:45:19.069 --> 01:45:20.278
What happened?

1030
01:45:20.445 --> 01:45:22.239
Your father had a stroke.

1031
01:45:22.405 --> 01:45:25.534
He's upstairs with your mom
and Dr. Bennett.

1032
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.035
Is he gonna be okay?

1033
01:45:35.127 --> 01:45:37.087
I don't suppose that I could

1034
01:45:37.254 --> 01:45:39.756
stay here with him.
I mean, in case...

1035
01:45:40.590 --> 01:45:43.510
In case he wakes up,
I really ought to be here.

1036
01:45:43.677 --> 01:45:44.970
I'll stay.

1037
01:45:45.971 --> 01:45:49.015
Why don't you go home with
Josephine. I'll stay tonight.

1038
01:45:50.851 --> 01:45:53.812
- Is that okay?
- Fine.

1039
01:45:56.731 --> 01:45:59.651
Will, you'll call if there's any... ?

1040
01:45:59.818 --> 01:46:02.946
I will. I will. I'll call.

1041
01:46:04.489 --> 01:46:08.493
- Do you want some time with Dad?
- Yes. Thank you.

1042
01:47:12.599 --> 01:47:16.144
Glad to see you're not trying
to have a heartfelt talk.

1043
01:47:19.314 --> 01:47:21.900
One of my greatest
annoyances is when

1044
01:47:22.067 --> 01:47:25.028
people try to talk to those
who can't hear them.

1045
01:47:25.195 --> 01:47:27.322
Well, we have an advantage.

1046
01:47:27.489 --> 01:47:29.908
My father and I never talk.

1047
01:47:36.456 --> 01:47:39.543
Your father ever tell you
about the day you were born?

1048
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:43.130
Yeah, a thousand times.
He caught an uncatchable fish.

1049
01:47:43.296 --> 01:47:47.259
Not that. The real story.
He ever tell you that?

1050
01:47:47.426 --> 01:47:49.261
No.

1051
01:47:49.428 --> 01:47:52.931
Well, your mother came in about
3 in the afternoon.

1052
01:47:53.098 --> 01:47:57.561
Her neighbour drove her, on account of
your father was away on business

1053
01:47:57.727 --> 01:47:59.396
in Wichita.

1054
01:47:59.563 --> 01:48:03.900
You were born a week early,
but there were no complications.

1055
01:48:04.067 --> 01:48:09.739
It was a perfect delivery.
Your father was sorry not to be there.

1056
01:48:10.282 --> 01:48:14.995
But it wasn't the custom then for men
to be in the room for deliveries

1057
01:48:15.162 --> 01:48:19.458
so I can't see how it would've been
much different had he been there.

1058
01:48:19.624 --> 01:48:22.377
And that's the real story
of how you were born.

1059
01:48:23.003 --> 01:48:25.464
Not very exciting, is it?

1060
01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:29.468
And I suppose if I had to choose
between the true version

1061
01:48:29.634 --> 01:48:34.181
and an elaborate one involving
a fish and a wedding ring

1062
01:48:34.347 --> 01:48:36.308
I might choose the fancy version.

1063
01:48:37.017 --> 01:48:38.977
But, then that's just me.

1064
01:48:40.061 --> 01:48:41.605
I kind of liked your version.

1065
01:49:04.169 --> 01:49:05.754
Dad?

1066
01:49:07.881 --> 01:49:11.468
Hey, Dad? Hey, you want me
to get the nurse?

1067
01:49:13.345 --> 01:49:16.389
What do you want? What can I do?
What can I get?

1068
01:49:16.556 --> 01:49:18.642
You want some water?

1069
01:49:19.684 --> 01:49:21.186
You want a bit of water?

1070
01:49:24.106 --> 01:49:26.817
The river.

1071
01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.195
The river?

1072
01:49:30.695 --> 01:49:34.866
Tell me how it happens.

1073
01:49:36.743 --> 01:49:38.703
How what happens?

1074
01:49:39.704 --> 01:49:42.165
How I go.

1075
01:49:46.545 --> 01:49:49.005
You mean what you saw in The Eye?

1076
01:50:03.019 --> 01:50:06.356
I don't know that story, Dad.
You never told me that one.

1077
01:50:09.234 --> 01:50:12.279
Okay. Hey, okay, I'll try.

1078
01:50:12.446 --> 01:50:15.073
I need your help.
Tell me how it starts.

1079
01:50:17.325 --> 01:50:20.996
Like this.

1080
01:50:21.163 --> 01:50:23.206
Okay. Okay.

1081
01:50:25.834 --> 01:50:29.296
Okay, so it's in the morning

1082
01:50:29.463 --> 01:50:33.592
and you and I are in the hospital,
and I've fallen asleep. And I wake up...

1083
01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:37.429
<i>and I see you,
and somehow you're better.

1084
01:50:37.596 --> 01:50:38.722
Dad?

1085
01:50:38.889 --> 01:50:40.932
<i>You're different.

1086
01:50:41.808 --> 01:50:44.811
- Dad.
- Let's get out of here.

1087
01:50:44.978 --> 01:50:46.271
<i>Then I say I

1088
01:50:46.438 --> 01:50:47.856
Dad, you're in no condition...

1089
01:50:48.023 --> 01:50:50.442
Get that wheelchair.

1090
01:50:52.861 --> 01:50:54.780
Hurry up! We haven't much time!

1091
01:50:54.946 --> 01:50:57.407
Once we get off this floor,
we're in the clear.

1092
01:50:57.574 --> 01:50:59.284
And we get in the wheelchair...

1093
01:50:59.451 --> 01:51:02.788
- Faster!
- ... like we're escaping the hospital.

1094
01:51:02.954 --> 01:51:04.790
What are you doing?

1095
01:51:04.956 --> 01:51:07.292
<i>We pass Dr. Bennett,
who tries to slow us down.

1096
01:51:07.459 --> 01:51:10.462
- Stop them!
- We're flying down the hall.

1097
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:12.547
Orderly after orderly is chasing us.

1098
01:51:12.714 --> 01:51:14.800
<i>Mom and Josephine
are at the end.

1099
01:51:14.966 --> 01:51:17.719
No time to explain! Stall them!

1100
01:51:23.391 --> 01:51:25.435
We come flying out
over the curb...

1101
01:51:25.602 --> 01:51:29.981
<i>and your old red Charger is there.
But it's new. Brand-new.

1102
01:51:30.148 --> 01:51:32.484
And I pick you up

1103
01:51:32.651 --> 01:51:36.279
and somehow you hardly weigh
anything. I can't explain it.

1104
01:51:40.534 --> 01:51:43.286
Leave it! We don't need it!

1105
01:51:45.330 --> 01:51:47.666
Water. I need water.

1106
01:51:51.002 --> 01:51:53.004
- Where are we going?
- The river.

1107
01:52:00.011 --> 01:52:02.514
And we have to take Glenville
to avoid traffic

1108
01:52:02.681 --> 01:52:05.434
because the damn church
people drive too slow.

1109
01:52:46.224 --> 01:52:51.480
And as we get close to the river...

1110
01:53:00.113 --> 01:53:02.324
He's here!

1111
01:53:02.616 --> 01:53:05.494
<i>we see that everybody
is already there.

1112
01:53:21.927 --> 01:53:23.512
And I mean

1113
01:53:24.763 --> 01:53:26.056
everyone.

1114
01:53:38.568 --> 01:53:41.279
It's unbelievable.

1115
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:45.951
The story of my life.

1116
01:53:54.501 --> 01:53:57.462
The strange thing is, there's
not a sad face to be found.

1117
01:53:57.629 --> 01:54:00.173
Everyone is just so glad
to see you

1118
01:54:01.299 --> 01:54:03.593
and send you off right.

1119
01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:09.391
Goodbye, everybody!
Farewell! Adieu!

1120
01:54:20.735 --> 01:54:23.321
My girl in the river.

1121
01:55:34.893 --> 01:55:37.729
You become what you always were.

1122
01:55:39.356 --> 01:55:41.733
A very big fish.

1123
01:55:46.822 --> 01:55:49.157
And that's how it happens.

1124
01:55:50.742 --> 01:55:52.536
Yeah.

1125
01:55:54.996 --> 01:55:57.582
Exactly.

1126
01:56:39.624 --> 01:56:41.042
Mom?

1127
01:58:08.255 --> 01:58:11.508
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

1128
01:58:11.675 --> 01:58:15.220
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

1129
01:58:15.387 --> 01:58:18.348
He leads me beside the quiet waters.

1130
01:58:18.515 --> 01:58:20.475
He restores my soul.

1131
01:58:20.642 --> 01:58:24.646
He guides me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

1132
01:58:25.272 --> 01:58:28.525
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death

1133
01:58:28.692 --> 01:58:31.319
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

1134
01:58:31.486 --> 01:58:35.824
Surely goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life.

1135
01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:27.250
<i>Have you ever heard a joke so many
times you've forgotten why it's funny?

1136
01:59:27.417 --> 01:59:31.505
<i>And then you hear it again
and suddenly it's new.

1137
01:59:31.671 --> 01:59:34.841
<i>You remember why you loved it
in the first place.

1138
01:59:36.676 --> 01:59:39.888
So he said he'll fight the giant
who was 15 feet tall!

1139
01:59:40.055 --> 01:59:43.475
- No way!
- Dad! That's right, isn't it?

1140
01:59:43.642 --> 01:59:44.976
Pretty much.

1141
01:59:45.143 --> 01:59:47.395
See? So he was a giant.

1142
01:59:47.562 --> 01:59:50.023
<i>That was my father's final joke,
I guess.

1143
01:59:50.190 --> 01:59:56.154
<i>A man tells his stories so many times
that he becomes the stories.

1144
01:59:57.572 --> 01:59:59.908
<i>They live on after him.

1145
02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:05.539
<i>And in that way,
he becomes immortal.
