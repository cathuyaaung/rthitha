2
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.407
You're looking good, Dutch.

3
00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:01.374
It's been a long time, General.

4
00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:03.388
Come on inside.

5
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.381
Eighteen hours ago,
we lost a chopper ...

6
00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:09.384
carrying a cabinet minister
and his aide ...

7
00:04:09.927 --> 00:04:10.389
from this charming
little country.

8
00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:15.396
We've got a transponder fix
on their position about here.

9
00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:19.399
This cabinet minister ...

10
00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:22.401
does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

11
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.406
Apparently
they strayed off course ...

12
00:04:26.864 --> 00:04:28.408
and we're fairly certain
they're in guerrilla hands.

13
00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:30.411
Why don't you use
the regular army?

14
00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:32.413
What do you need us for?

15
00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:36.418
'Cause some damned fool
accused you of being the best.

16
00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.426
Dillon!

17
00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.431
You son of a bitch!

18
00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:54.437
What's the matter?

19
00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:57.398
The CIA got you pushing
too many pencils?

20
00:04:57.857 --> 00:04:59.401
Huh?

21
00:05:02.863 --> 00:05:03.405
Had enough?

22
00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:05.408
Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

23
00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:10.413
OK! OK, OK.

24
00:05:10.872 --> 00:05:12.415
You never knew when to quit.

25
00:05:12.874 --> 00:05:13.416
Damn good to see you.

26
00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.418
What's this
fucking tie business?

27
00:05:15.877 --> 00:05:17.421
Come on. Forget about my tie.

28
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.424
I heard about that job
you pulled in Berlin.

29
00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:21.425
Very nice, Dutch.

30
00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:24.428
- Good old days.
- The good old days.

31
00:05:24.887 --> 00:05:27.431
- Why'd you pass on Libya?
- That wasn't my style.

32
00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:30.435
You got no style.
You know that.

33
00:05:30.894 --> 00:05:32.437
Come on. Why did you pass?

34
00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:38.361
We're a rescue team ...
not assassins.

35
00:05:40.905 --> 00:05:43.366
Now, what do we got to do?

36
00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:46.370
The cabinet minister's important
to our scope of operations ...

37
00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:47.371
in this part of the world.

38
00:05:47.913 --> 00:05:50.374
Our friends
are about to get squeezed.

39
00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:52.377
We can't let that happen.
We need the best.

40
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.379
That's why you're here.

41
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:56.380
Go on.

42
00:05:56.922 --> 00:05:58.383
Simple setup.
One-day operation.

43
00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.385
We pick up their trail,
run 'em down ...

44
00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.387
grab those hostages,
and cross the border ...

45
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.390
before anybody knows
we were there.

46
00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:06.392
What do you mean, "we"?

47
00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.394
I'm going in with you, Dutch.

48
00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:13.399
General,
my team always works alone.

49
00:06:13.857 --> 00:06:15.402
You know that.

50
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.405
We all have our orders, Major.

51
00:06:18.863 --> 00:06:20.407
Once you reach your objective ...

52
00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:23.411
Dillon will evaluate
the situation and take charge.

Lines away.

133
00:13:10.904 --> 00:13:13.365

got one round in the head.

Whoever hit it,
stripped the shit out of it.

135
00:13:16.911 --> 00:13:18.370
Took him out
with a heat-seeker.

136
00:13:18.912 --> 00:13:22.375
Something else, Major.
This is no ordinary army taxi.

137
00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:25.378
It looks more like
a surveillance bird to me.

138
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.381
Pick up the trail yet?

139
00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:31.385
Billy's on it.
Heat-seeker, Dillon.

140
00:13:31.927 --> 00:13:34.388
That's pretty sophisticated
for half-assed mountain boys.

141
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.390
I guess they're getting
better equipped every day.

142
00:13:37.849 --> 00:13:39.394
There were 12 guerrillas.

143
00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:42.397
They took the two men
from the helicopter ...

144
00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:43.398
but there's something else.

145
00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:44.400
What?

146
00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:47.403
Six men wearing
US-issued army boots.

147
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.404
They came in from the north ...

148
00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.407
and then they followed
the guerrillas.

149
00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:54.410
Mean anything to you?

150
00:13:56.871 --> 00:13:59.416
Probably just another
rebel patrol.

151
00:13:59.874 --> 00:14:01.418
They operate in here
all the time.

152
00:14:02.878 --> 00:14:05.422
- See what you can find.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:14:35.873 --> 00:14:37.416
What's he got?

154
00:14:37.875 --> 00:14:38.417
Same business.

155
00:14:38.876 --> 00:14:40.419
Guerrillas hauling two guys
in the chopper ...

156
00:14:40.878 --> 00:14:43.423
followed by men
with American equipment.

157
00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:46.426
Do you remember Afghanistan?

158
00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:49.346
Trying to forget it.
Come on. Let's go.

159
00:16:05.848 --> 00:16:06.390
Oh!

160
00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:07.391
God!

161
00:16:14.857 --> 00:16:16.401
Holy mother of God.

162
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.350
"Jim Hopper."

163
00:16:46.893 --> 00:16:48.352
Mac, cut them down.

164
00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:03.369
I knew these men.
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.

165
00:17:03.912 --> 00:17:05.371
What the hell
were they doing here?

166
00:17:05.914 --> 00:17:08.374
I don't know, Dutch.
This is inhuman.

167
00:17:08.918 --> 00:17:11.378
Nobody told me there was
an operation in this area.

168
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:13.380
They shouldn't have been here.

169
00:17:13.923 --> 00:17:15.382
Well, somebody sent them.

170
00:17:19.887 --> 00:17:21.348
The guerrillas skinned them?

171
00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:24.393
Why did they skin them?

172
00:17:25.852 --> 00:17:28.398
Ain't no way
for no soldier to die.

173
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.404
What happened here, Billy?

174
00:17:34.862 --> 00:17:38.409
Strange, Major.
There was a fire fight.

175
00:17:39.868 --> 00:17:42.413
They were shooting
in all directions.

176
00:17:42.871 --> 00:17:45.417
Can't believe Jim Hopper
walked into an ambush.

177
00:17:45.875 --> 00:17:47.418
I don't believe he did.

178
00:17:47.876 --> 00:17:51.423
I can't find a single track.

179
00:17:51.881 --> 00:17:53.425
Just doesn't make sense.

180
00:17:53.883 --> 00:17:55.386
What about the rest
of Hopper's men?

181
00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:56.387
There's no sign, sir.

182
00:17:58.848 --> 00:17:59.390
They never left here.

183
00:18:02.852 --> 00:18:04.395
Hell, it's like
they just disappeared.

184
00:18:07.858 --> 00:18:09.401
Stick with the guerrilla trail.

185
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.403
Let's get the hostages.

186
00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:14.407
We move, five-meter spread.

187
00:18:14.866 --> 00:18:15.408
No sound.

188
00:18:16.868 --> 00:18:19.412
It's time to let Old Painless
out of the bag.

189
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.419
Payback time.

190
00:19:56.853 --> 00:19:58.397
You're ghostin' us,
mother fucker.

191
00:19:58.856 --> 00:20:01.400
I don't care who you are
back in the world.

192
00:20:01.859 --> 00:20:03.402
You give our position
one more time ...

193
00:20:03.862 --> 00:20:06.406
I'll bleed you real quiet
and leave you here.

194
00:20:06.865 --> 00:20:08.407
Got that?

195
00:21:18.902 --> 00:21:19.361
Aah!

196
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:26.370
Fuck you.

197
00:21:26.912 --> 00:21:27.370
Aah!

198
00:21:55.861 --> 00:21:58.405
He killed one of the hostages.
We move.

199
00:21:58.863 --> 00:22:00.406
Mac, Blain ... the nest.

200
00:22:00.866 --> 00:22:02.409
Billy, Poncho ... the guard.

201
00:22:02.868 --> 00:22:03.410
Hawkins, Dillon ... backup.

202
00:22:03.869 --> 00:22:05.412
Once they're set,
I hit the fuel dump.

203
00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:06.355
One down.

204
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.339
What the hell's he doing?

205
00:24:22.898 --> 00:24:23.356
What the fuck?

206
00:24:34.912 --> 00:24:36.370
Show time, kid.

207
00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.361
Target's the center,
on the upper level!

208
00:25:28.846 --> 00:25:30.389
Dutch, on your nine!

209
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.339
Get that mother!

210
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:47.350
Go.

211
00:27:19.844 --> 00:27:20.386
Hyah!

212
00:27:22.848 --> 00:27:23.390
Stick around.

213
00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:25.392
Hostages are inside!

214
00:27:31.857 --> 00:27:33.400
Knock knock.

215
00:27:43.871 --> 00:27:45.415
I got 'em!

216
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:48.333
Hawkins, call in position
and situation.

217
00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:50.335
Get Connor for the hook!

218
00:27:50.878 --> 00:27:51.337
You got it, Major.

219
00:27:59.889 --> 00:28:01.348
Shit.

220
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.351
Mac, any sign
of the other hostage?

221
00:28:05.895 --> 00:28:07.354
Found the other guy.

222
00:28:07.897 --> 00:28:11.359
He's dead, too ...
and the kid from the chopper.

223
00:28:11.902 --> 00:28:14.363
But if they're Central American,
I'm a Goddamn Chinaman.

224
00:28:14.906 --> 00:28:17.365
From the looks of it,
our cabinet minister was CIA.

225
00:28:17.908 --> 00:28:19.367
Another thing, Major.
We were lucky.

226
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.371
Other guys we waxed ...
Russian military advisers.

227
00:28:24.874 --> 00:28:26.335
Something pretty big
was gonna happen here.

228
00:28:26.877 --> 00:28:27.336
Good work, Mac.

229
00:28:27.878 --> 00:28:30.339
Clear the area. No traces.
Get the men ready to move.

230
00:28:30.881 --> 00:28:31.340
Right.

231
00:28:39.891 --> 00:28:42.352
Son of a bitch
is dug in like an Alabama tick.

232
00:28:43.896 --> 00:28:45.356
You're hit.
You're bleeding, man.

233
00:28:45.898 --> 00:28:47.358
I ain't got time to bleed.

234
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.361
Oh ... OK.

235
00:28:54.907 --> 00:28:55.367
You got time to duck?

236
00:29:02.834 --> 00:29:04.377
This is goddamn beautiful.

237
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.383
Goddamn jackpot.

238
00:29:10.842 --> 00:29:13.387
This is more than
we ever thought we'd get.

239
00:29:14.847 --> 00:29:16.390
Now we got those bastards.

240
00:29:18.852 --> 00:29:19.394
We got 'em.

241
00:29:19.853 --> 00:29:22.396
I think this is
what you're looking for.

242
00:29:22.855 --> 00:29:23.397
You set us up!

243
00:29:23.856 --> 00:29:26.401
It's all bullshit! All of it.

244
00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.404
The cabinet minister,
the whole business.

245
00:29:29.863 --> 00:29:31.407
Got us in here
to do your dirty work.

246
00:29:31.866 --> 00:29:33.409
We just stopped
a major invasion.

247
00:29:33.868 --> 00:29:35.411
In three days,
they'd have crossed the border.

248
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.330
- Why us?
- Nobody else could've done it.

249
00:29:38.873 --> 00:29:41.333
Pissed about the cover story?
I needed it to get you in here.

250
00:29:41.876 --> 00:29:42.335
What story did you hand Hopper?

251
00:29:42.878 --> 00:29:46.339
Look, we've been looking
for this place for months.

252
00:29:46.882 --> 00:29:48.342
My men were in that chopper
when it got hit!

253
00:29:48.885 --> 00:29:50.344
Hopper was supposed to get them.
He disappeared.

254
00:29:50.887 --> 00:29:53.346
He didn't disappear.
He was skinned alive!

255
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.349
My orders were to get somebody
to crack these bastards!

256
00:29:55.892 --> 00:29:58.352
So you cooked up a story and
dropped us in a meat grinder.

257
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.359
What happened to you, Dillon?

258
00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:07.363
You used to be somebody
I could trust.

259
00:30:07.905 --> 00:30:12.368
I woke up. Why don't you?

260
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:17.333
You're an asset ...
an expendable asset ...

261
00:30:18.876 --> 00:30:20.336
and I used you
to get the job done. Got it?

262
00:30:24.882 --> 00:30:25.341
My men are not expendable.

263
00:30:29.888 --> 00:30:31.348
And I don't do
this kind of work.

264
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.350
Major! We stepped
into some real shit here.

265
00:30:36.896 --> 00:30:39.356
Air surveillance says
we got guerrillas all over.

266
00:30:39.898 --> 00:30:41.359
Can't be more than
one, two miles away.

267
00:30:41.901 --> 00:30:43.361
- How much time?
- Half hour, maybe less.

268
00:30:43.903 --> 00:30:45.363
Tell Mac we move in five.

269
00:30:45.905 --> 00:30:48.367
Wait. She goes, too.
She's got valuable information.

270
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:51.370
She'll give away our position
any chance she gets. No deal.

271
00:30:51.912 --> 00:30:53.373
You're still under orders,
Major.

272
00:30:53.832 --> 00:30:55.374
You wanna make that call
or should I?

273
00:30:57.835 --> 00:30:59.379
She's your baggage.

274
00:30:59.838 --> 00:31:01.381
You fall behind,
and you're on your own.

275
00:31:10.851 --> 00:31:11.392
Place is too hot for a pickup.

276
00:31:12.852 --> 00:31:14.395
They won't touch us
till we get over the border.

277
00:31:14.854 --> 00:31:17.399
Hey, Billy,
give me a way out of this hole.

278
00:31:17.858 --> 00:31:19.401
Aerial says we're cut off.

279
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.406
The only way out is
that valley that leads east ...

280
00:31:23.865 --> 00:31:26.409
but I wouldn't wish that
on a broke-dick dog.

281
00:31:26.867 --> 00:31:28.411
Not much choice.

282
00:31:29.871 --> 00:31:31.330
Poncho, take lead.
Double-time it.

283
00:31:52.897 --> 00:31:53.355
Dillon!

284
00:31:53.898 --> 00:31:54.356
Dillon!

285
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.360
Over here.

286
00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:11.334
Turn around.

287
00:32:11.876 --> 00:32:12.335
Why?

288
00:32:23.889 --> 00:32:24.348
Thanks.

289
00:32:26.893 --> 00:32:28.353
Anytime.

290
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:36.361
Billy! Billy!

291
00:32:37.905 --> 00:32:40.366
The other day, I was going down
on my girlfriend ...

292
00:32:40.908 --> 00:32:42.368
and I said to her ...

293
00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.372
"Jeez, you got a big pussy.
Jeez, you got a big pussy."

294
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.373
She said,
"Why did you say that twice?"

295
00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:48.374
And I said, "I didn't."

296
00:32:50.836 --> 00:32:53.380
See, it was because
of the echo.

297
00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:54.381
It was ...

298
00:34:19.893 --> 00:34:21.352
Over here.
Over here. Over here.

299
00:34:23.897 --> 00:34:25.357
Turn around. Turn around.

300
00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:30.363
Turn around. Turn around.
Over here.

301
00:34:34.826 --> 00:34:36.369
Anytime.

302
00:34:50.844 --> 00:34:52.387
Anytime.

303
00:36:37.837 --> 00:36:40.382
Goddamn. Whew.

304
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.384
Buddy, buddy, buddy.

305
00:36:42.842 --> 00:36:47.389
I've seen some bad-ass bush
before, but nothing like this.

306
00:36:47.847 --> 00:36:49.392
I hear you.

307
00:36:49.851 --> 00:36:51.394
This shit's something.

308
00:36:51.853 --> 00:36:55.399
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

309
00:36:56.483 --> 00:36:59.482
Que pasa, amigo?
A little taste off home.

310
00:37:02.865 --> 00:37:04.324
You lose it here ...

311
00:37:04.867 --> 00:37:06.327
you're in a world of hurt.

312
00:37:15.879 --> 00:37:16.337
Come on, sweetheart.
Stop sandbaggin' it.

313
00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.340
Now get up.

314
00:37:18.883 --> 00:37:21.343
Come on, get up.
Would you get up?

315
00:37:21.886 --> 00:37:23.346
Mierda!

316
00:37:26.892 --> 00:37:27.350
Ni lo intentes.

317
00:37:31.897 --> 00:37:34.357
Maybe you better put her
on a leash, agent man.

318
00:37:42.868 --> 00:37:45.329
Try it again ... please.

319
00:38:37.844 --> 00:38:38.387
Callate.

320
00:38:49.857 --> 00:38:52.403
What's got Billy so spooked?

321
00:38:52.861 --> 00:38:54.321
Can't say, Major.

322
00:38:54.864 --> 00:38:57.325
Been acting squirrelly
all morning.

323
00:38:57.868 --> 00:39:01.329
That damn nose of his ...
it's weird.

324
00:39:42.875 --> 00:39:44.336
What is it?

325
00:39:47.881 --> 00:39:48.340
Billy.

326
00:39:51.885 --> 00:39:54.346
What the hell is wrong with you?

327
00:39:57.892 --> 00:40:00.353
There's something
in those trees.

328
00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:39.396
Do you see anything?

329
00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:41.398
Up there ahead.

330
00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:44.402
Nothing.

331
00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:47.363
What do you think?

332
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:55.372
I guess it's nothing, Major.

333
00:41:51.894 --> 00:41:54.355
Please!

334
00:41:54.897 --> 00:41:55.356
Please!

335
00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:03.364
Aah!

336
00:43:08.896 --> 00:43:11.356
Billy, break back.
Back right.

337
00:43:11.899 --> 00:43:13.317
What the ...

338
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.320
This isn't her blood.

339
00:43:15.862 --> 00:43:17.321
What the hell
did you do to him?

340
00:43:17.863 --> 00:43:19.323
Major,
you better take a look at this.

341
00:43:19.866 --> 00:43:21.326
Did you find Hawkins?

342
00:43:21.868 --> 00:43:24.329
I ... I can't tell.

343
00:43:42.892 --> 00:43:44.352
What in God's name?

344
00:43:45.895 --> 00:43:46.354
I think it's Hawkins.

345
00:43:48.898 --> 00:43:52.360
- Where the hell is his body?
- There's no sign of it.

346
00:43:53.819 --> 00:43:55.364
Ask her what happened.

347
00:44:00.828 --> 00:44:02.372
Que paso, mujer?

348
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.373
Mujer, que paso?

349
00:44:04.831 --> 00:44:07.377
Qué fue lo que viste?
Quien fue?

350
00:44:07.835 --> 00:44:09.379
Yo no se.

351
00:44:09.837 --> 00:44:11.381
Dime, mujer!
Quien fue? Dime!

352
00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:14.385
La selva se lo llevo.

353
00:44:14.843 --> 00:44:16.387
No estoy segura. No se.

354
00:44:16.845 --> 00:44:20.391
She says the jungle ...
it just came alive and took him.

355
00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:23.394
Bullshit!
That's not what she said!

356
00:44:23.853 --> 00:44:26.398
What she said
doesn't make any sense.

357
00:44:26.856 --> 00:44:29.359
- Those sappers followed us ...
- Hell, they've been ahead of us!

358
00:44:29.819 --> 00:44:32.363
This woman's been running us
right to 'em!

359
00:44:32.822 --> 00:44:33.364
Hold it!

360
00:44:33.823 --> 00:44:37.368
Why didn't they take his radio
or his weapon?

361
00:44:37.827 --> 00:44:38.369
Why didn't she escape?

362
00:44:42.833 --> 00:44:43.375
Hopper.

363
00:44:44.835 --> 00:44:45.377
What?

364
00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.382
They did the same thing
to Jim Hopper.

365
00:44:54.846 --> 00:44:56.389
I want Hawkins' body found.

366
00:44:56.848 --> 00:45:00.394
Sweep pattern. Double back.
50 meters. Let's go.

367
00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:53.394
Come on in, you fuckers.

368
00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:56.315
Come on in.

369
00:46:56.857 --> 00:46:58.316
Old Painless is waiting.

370
00:47:27.891 --> 00:47:32.354
Sergeant!

371
00:47:35.815 --> 00:47:37.360
Mother fucker!

372
00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:53.377
Fucker!

373
00:48:02.845 --> 00:48:05.390
Mother fucker!

374
00:48:16.819 --> 00:48:18.363
You mother fucker!

375
00:49:09.489 --> 00:49:09.990
What happened?

376
00:49:10.491 --> 00:49:10.991
I saw it.

377
00:49:11.492 --> 00:49:12.993
- You saw what?
- I saw it.

378
00:49:30.847 --> 00:49:32.348
Blain.

379
00:49:32.849 --> 00:49:36.352
No powder burns, no shrapnel.

380
00:49:36.853 --> 00:49:39.356
The wound's all fused,
cauterized.

381
00:49:39.857 --> 00:49:42.359
What the hell could have
done this to a man?

382
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.360
Mac.

383
00:49:43.861 --> 00:49:45.363
Mac, look at me!

384
00:49:46.865 --> 00:49:48.366
Who did this?

385
00:49:48.867 --> 00:49:49.367
I don't know, goddamn it.

386
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:51.370
I saw s-something.

387
00:49:55.874 --> 00:49:58.377
Not a thing,
not a fucking trace.

388
00:49:58.878 --> 00:50:00.379
No blood, no bodies.

389
00:50:00.838 --> 00:50:02.339
We hit nothing.

390
00:50:09.848 --> 00:50:11.349
Dillon ...

391
00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:13.351
better get on the radio.

392
00:50:14.854 --> 00:50:15.354
Mac.

393
00:50:17.857 --> 00:50:19.358
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir.

394
00:50:19.859 --> 00:50:21.361
I want a defensive position
above that ridge ...

395
00:50:21.862 --> 00:50:23.362
mined with everything we've got.

396
00:50:25.866 --> 00:50:28.368
Put him in his poncho.
Take him with us.

397
00:50:28.869 --> 00:50:29.369
I got him.

398
00:50:46.847 --> 00:50:47.348
Vamonos.

399
00:51:33.858 --> 00:51:35.359
Major ...

400
00:51:35.861 --> 00:51:38.363
I set up flares, frags,
and claymores.

401
00:51:38.864 --> 00:51:42.367
Nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on something.

402
00:51:42.868 --> 00:51:44.369
Thank you, sergeant.

403
00:51:45.871 --> 00:51:47.372
Mac.

404
00:51:48.875 --> 00:51:50.376
He was a good soldier.

405
00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:54.339
He was, um ...

406
00:51:55.841 --> 00:51:57.342
my friend.

407
00:53:05.835 --> 00:53:06.335
Good-bye, bro.

408
00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:17.372
Blazer one, I repeat,
extraction necessary.

409
00:54:18.874 --> 00:54:20.334
Say again, Blazer one.
Say again.

410
00:54:21.835 --> 00:54:23.337
Request for extraction denied.

411
00:54:24.838 --> 00:54:25.340
Area is still compromised.

412
00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.343
Proceed to sector 3,000
for prisoner extraction.

413
00:54:28.843 --> 00:54:31.347
Priority, out.
Next contact 09:30.

414
00:54:31.847 --> 00:54:34.350
Roger, Blazer one.
10:30 hours.

415
00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:36.351
Damn bastards.

416
00:54:36.851 --> 00:54:39.355
They say we're still in too far,
and they can't risk coming in.

417
00:54:40.856 --> 00:54:43.360
We're assets, Dillon.
Expendable assets.

418
00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:46.363
It comes with the job.
I can accept it.

419
00:54:46.863 --> 00:54:49.367
Bullshit.
You're just like the rest of us.

420
00:54:50.868 --> 00:54:54.371
Shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow.

421
00:54:57.834 --> 00:54:59.335
Sergeant?

422
00:54:59.836 --> 00:55:01.338
Sergeant! Sergeant!

423
00:55:01.839 --> 00:55:03.340
Who hit us today?

424
00:55:03.841 --> 00:55:06.344
I don't know.

425
00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:08.345
I only saw one of them
camouflaged.

426
00:55:09.847 --> 00:55:11.348
He was there.

427
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:14.352
Those eyes disappeared.

428
00:55:14.853 --> 00:55:15.353
What was that?

429
00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:18.357
Those eyes, they ...

430
00:55:18.858 --> 00:55:20.359
they disappeared.

431
00:55:21.861 --> 00:55:22.361
I know one thing, Major.

432
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:25.364
I drew down
and fired straight at it.

433
00:55:25.865 --> 00:55:28.367
Capped off 200 rounds
in the mini-gun ...

434
00:55:28.868 --> 00:55:30.370
Full pack.

435
00:55:30.871 --> 00:55:32.372
Nothing ...

436
00:55:32.873 --> 00:55:34.332
nothing on this earth
could have lived.

437
00:55:34.833 --> 00:55:37.336
Not at that range.

438
00:55:40.839 --> 00:55:43.342
Mac, you take first watch ...

439
00:55:43.843 --> 00:55:46.345
then you get some rest, OK?

440
00:55:46.846 --> 00:55:48.348
Ask her what she saw.

441
00:55:48.849 --> 00:55:50.350
Ask her what happened
to Hawkins.

442
00:55:51.852 --> 00:55:52.352
Go ahead, ask her.

443
00:55:53.855 --> 00:55:55.355
Qué pasó hoy?

444
00:55:56.857 --> 00:55:57.357
Qué fue lo que viste?

445
00:55:57.858 --> 00:56:01.362
Te dijo lo que sé.
Fue la selva que se lo llevó.

446
00:56:01.863 --> 00:56:02.363
Qué más quiere que te diga?

447
00:56:02.864 --> 00:56:04.365
Same fucking thing.

448
00:56:04.867 --> 00:56:06.368
The jungle,
it came alive and took him.

449
00:56:08.871 --> 00:56:10.372
Billy, you know something.

450
00:56:10.831 --> 00:56:11.332
What is it?

451
00:56:11.832 --> 00:56:14.335
I'm scared, Poncho.

452
00:56:14.835 --> 00:56:17.339
Bullshit.
You ain't afraid of no man.

453
00:56:17.839 --> 00:56:20.342
There's something out there
waiting for us ...

454
00:56:22.845 --> 00:56:23.346
and it ain't no man.

455
00:56:32.855 --> 00:56:34.358
We're all gonna die.

456
00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:39.363
The man's losing it.
He's losing his cool.

457
00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:41.366
Nothing but a couple guys
running around ...

458
00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:42.366
and we gotta take 'em.

459
00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:45.370
Still don't understand,
Dillon, do you?

460
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:49.332
Whatever it is out there,
it killed Hopper ...

461
00:56:49.833 --> 00:56:51.335
and now it wants us.

462
00:56:56.841 --> 00:56:59.343
Here we are again, bro ...

463
00:57:00.845 --> 00:57:02.346
just you and me.

464
00:57:02.848 --> 00:57:06.351
Same kind of moon,
same kind of jungle.

465
00:57:06.852 --> 00:57:09.355
Real number-ten night, remember?

466
00:57:09.856 --> 00:57:12.358
Whole platoon ...
32 men chopped into meat ...

467
00:57:12.859 --> 00:57:14.359
and we walk out,
just you and me.

468
00:57:14.861 --> 00:57:15.361
Nobody else.

469
00:57:15.862 --> 00:57:17.363
Right on top of them.

470
00:57:19.866 --> 00:57:21.368
Not a scratch.
Not a fucking scratch.

471
00:57:21.869 --> 00:57:23.370
You know, whoever got you ...

472
00:57:23.871 --> 00:57:25.330
he'll come back again,
and when he does ...

473
00:57:25.831 --> 00:57:27.333
I'm going to cut your name
right into him.

474
00:57:29.835 --> 00:57:32.338
I'm going to cut your name
into him.

475
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.361
- What the hell is it?
- Mac!

476
00:57:57.867 --> 00:57:58.367
Where are you?

477
00:57:58.868 --> 00:57:59.368
Over here!

478
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:03.331
Mac!

479
00:58:03.831 --> 00:58:05.333
Aah!

480
00:58:07.836 --> 00:58:08.337
Mac!

481
00:58:08.837 --> 00:58:09.338
Fuck!

482
00:58:12.841 --> 00:58:15.345
Mac, where are you?

483
00:58:19.849 --> 00:58:21.351
Mac, where are you?

484
00:58:23.853 --> 00:58:24.354
Jesus.

485
00:58:24.855 --> 00:58:29.360
I got you, mother fucker.
I killed you, you fuck.

486
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.364
Jesus, you killed a pig.

487
00:58:33.864 --> 00:58:36.368
Think you could have
found something bigger?

488
00:58:36.868 --> 00:58:39.329
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you.

489
00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:41.331
Where's the girl?

490
00:58:41.832 --> 00:58:43.334
Aw, shit!

491
00:58:44.836 --> 00:58:47.338
Why the hell
wasn't anybody watching her?

492
00:58:50.842 --> 00:58:54.346
Why didn't she try to get away?

493
00:58:54.847 --> 00:58:57.349
Look at her.
She's scared out of her mind.

494
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:00.353
Major,
you better take a look at this.

495
00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.361
Blain's body, it's gone.

496
00:59:08.862 --> 00:59:12.366
It came in through
the tripwires.

497
00:59:12.867 --> 00:59:15.369
Took it right out
from under our noses.

498
00:59:27.841 --> 00:59:30.344
That boar had to set off
a trip-flare ...

499
00:59:30.845 --> 00:59:32.346
because there ain't
no other tracks.

500
00:59:32.847 --> 00:59:34.348
How could anyone
get through this ...

501
00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:37.351
and carry out Blain
without us knowing it?

502
00:59:38.853 --> 00:59:41.356
Why didn't he try and kill
one of us?

503
00:59:42.858 --> 00:59:43.358
He came to get the body.

504
00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.362
He's killing us one at a time.

505
00:59:47.864 --> 00:59:48.364
Like a hunter.

506
01:00:05.842 --> 01:00:07.343
He's using the trees.

507
01:00:18.856 --> 01:00:20.358
Yesterday, what did you see?

508
01:00:20.858 --> 01:00:22.361
You're wasting your time.

509
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.362
No more games.

510
01:00:28.867 --> 01:00:32.329
I don't know what it was.
It ...

511
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.332
Go on.

512
01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:37.335
It changed colors
like the chameleon.

513
01:00:37.836 --> 01:00:39.337
It uses the jungle.

514
01:00:39.838 --> 01:00:43.341
Blain and Hawkins
were killed by a lizard?

515
01:00:43.842 --> 01:00:47.346
That's a bullshit psych job.
There's 2 or 3 men out there.

516
01:00:47.847 --> 01:00:48.347
Fucking lizard!

517
01:00:50.851 --> 01:00:53.353
What's your name?

518
01:00:53.854 --> 01:00:54.353
Anna.

519
01:00:58.859 --> 01:01:02.363
Anna, the thing is hunting us.

520
01:01:02.864 --> 01:01:04.365
All of us.

521
01:01:04.866 --> 01:01:06.367
You know that.

522
01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:13.332
- What the hell are you doing?
- We'll need everyone.

523
01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:15.335
I'm taking her back.
We leave in five minutes.

524
01:01:15.836 --> 01:01:18.588
- We're not going yet.
- Rendezvous is ten miles away.

525
01:01:18.838 --> 01:01:20.841
You think
the chopper's going to wait?

526
01:01:20.842 --> 01:01:24.345
We make a stand now,
or nobody will be left.

527
01:01:24.846 --> 01:01:26.347
There is something else.

528
01:01:26.848 --> 01:01:31.352
When the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.

529
01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:34.356
Its blood was on the leaves.

530
01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.360
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

531
01:02:04.848 --> 01:02:05.349
Look out.

532
01:02:26.832 --> 01:02:29.333
You really think this Boy Scout
bullshit's gonna work?

533
01:02:29.834 --> 01:02:33.338
It can see tripwires.
Maybe it can't see this.

534
01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.343
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

535
01:03:36.825 --> 01:03:39.328
What makes you think
he'll come through here?

536
01:03:39.828 --> 01:03:41.331
The trees have tripwires
every 50 yards.

537
01:03:41.831 --> 01:03:44.334
This is the only way in.

538
01:04:10.863 --> 01:04:12.323
When I was little,
we found a man.

539
01:04:12.824 --> 01:04:17.329
He looked like ... like butchered.

540
01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:20.331
The old women in the village
crossed themselves ...

541
01:04:20.833 --> 01:04:22.334
and whispered crazy things,
such strange things.

542
01:04:22.835 --> 01:04:27.340
EI diablo, cazador de hombres.

543
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:30.343
Only in the hottest years
this happens.

544
01:04:33.848 --> 01:04:35.348
And this year, it grows hot.

545
01:04:37.851 --> 01:04:40.354
We begin finding our men.

546
01:04:40.855 --> 01:04:44.359
We found them sometimes
without their skin ...

547
01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.361
and sometimes much, much worse.

548
01:04:50.825 --> 01:04:53.326
EI que hace trofeos
de los hombres ...

549
01:04:53.827 --> 01:04:57.331
means "the demon
who makes trophies of man."

550
01:05:16.853 --> 01:05:18.354
What you gonna try next, cheese?

551
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.360
Hey, Dutch.

552
01:05:24.861 --> 01:05:25.362
Dutch!

553
01:06:34.897 --> 01:06:35.399
Shit!

554
01:07:11.898 --> 01:07:14.399
I got you, you mother!
I got you!

555
01:07:15.901 --> 01:07:18.362
I'm coming!

556
01:07:18.863 --> 01:07:21.365
Mac! Mac!
Get Ramirez to the chopper.

557
01:07:21.867 --> 01:07:24.369
Hold it. I'm going after Mac.

558
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:26.371
That's not your style, Dillon.

559
01:07:26.872 --> 01:07:29.374
I picked up bad habits from you.
Get your people the hell out.

560
01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:31.376
You can't win this, Dillon.

561
01:07:31.877 --> 01:07:34.380
Maybe I can get even.

562
01:07:36.883 --> 01:07:37.383
Dillon.

563
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:45.392
Just hold onto
that damn chopper.

564
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:55.362
He's busted up
pretty bad, Major.

565
01:07:55.862 --> 01:07:58.366
I can make it. I can make it.

566
01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:01.368
Get the radio. Forget the rest.

567
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:03.371
Come on, Poncho.

568
01:08:25.895 --> 01:08:26.397
Long Tall Sally ...

569
01:08:26.897 --> 01:08:28.399
she's built sweet!

570
01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:30.401
She's got everything ...

571
01:08:30.901 --> 01:08:32.361
that Uncle John need.

572
01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:33.362
Oh, baby.

573
01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:36.365
Oh, baby.

574
01:08:36.866 --> 01:08:39.369
I'm gonna have me some fun.

575
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:41.371
I'm gonna have me some fun.

576
01:08:42.873 --> 01:08:43.373
I'm gonna have me some fun.

577
01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:45.376
I'm gonna have me some fun.

578
01:08:46.878 --> 01:08:47.378
I'm gonna have me some fun.

579
01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.361
Turn around.

580
01:09:14.867 --> 01:09:15.367
Over here.

581
01:09:20.873 --> 01:09:22.374
Over here.

582
01:09:29.883 --> 01:09:31.385
Mac?

583
01:09:39.894 --> 01:09:41.395
Shh.

584
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.360
Out there.

585
01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:49.364
Past them trees.

586
01:09:51.865 --> 01:09:53.367
You see it?

587
01:09:58.873 --> 01:10:01.377
I see you.

588
01:10:09.885 --> 01:10:10.386
I see it.

589
01:10:12.889 --> 01:10:13.390
Yeah ...

590
01:10:15.892 --> 01:10:17.395
I see it.

591
01:10:19.897 --> 01:10:23.359
You know,
we can get this thing, Mac.

592
01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:26.362
You work your way down there
toward him.

593
01:10:26.863 --> 01:10:29.366
I'll get in back of him,
flush him toward you.

594
01:10:29.867 --> 01:10:32.369
When I flush the son of a bitch,
you nail him.

595
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:34.371
I got a score to settle.

596
01:10:34.873 --> 01:10:37.375
We've both got scores to settle.

597
01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:01.384
Vamos!

598
01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:06.390
Vamos!

599
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.393
Come on! Quickly!

600
01:12:08.893 --> 01:12:09.394
Hurry up!

601
01:12:09.894 --> 01:12:10.395
Don't. Leave it.

602
01:12:10.895 --> 01:12:13.397
It didn't kill you
because you weren't armed.

603
01:12:13.857 --> 01:12:15.358
No sport.

604
01:12:46.893 --> 01:12:47.393
Mac.

605
01:12:49.897 --> 01:12:50.397
Mac.

606
01:12:58.865 --> 01:12:59.365
Anytime.

607
01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:18.370
Let's go.

608
01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:29.382
Billy!

609
01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:32.385
Billy, let's go!

610
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:59.373
Dame l'arma! Dame l'arma!

611
01:14:59.874 --> 01:15:00.374
Give me the weapon!

612
01:15:19.854 --> 01:15:21.357
Dame la mano!

613
01:15:56.853 --> 01:15:57.354
No!

614
01:15:57.854 --> 01:15:58.355
Run!

615
01:16:08.867 --> 01:16:09.368
Run!

616
01:16:09.867 --> 01:16:11.369
Go!

617
01:16:11.869 --> 01:16:14.373
Get to the chopper!

618
01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.382
Oh, shit!

619
01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.348
He couldn't see me.

620
01:32:07.888 --> 01:32:09.389
Bleed, bastard.

621
01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:44.377
You're one ugly motherfucker.

622
01:36:02.898 --> 01:36:04.399
Bad idea.

623
01:38:03.907 --> 01:38:05.408
Come on.

624
01:38:05.909 --> 01:38:08.412
Come on! Do it!

625
01:38:08.913 --> 01:38:09.372
Do it!

626
01:38:11.874 --> 01:38:13.377
Come on. Come on!

627
01:38:13.877 --> 01:38:15.379
Kill me! I'm here! Kill me!

628
01:38:16.879 --> 01:38:19.383
I'm here! Kill me!

629
01:38:19.883 --> 01:38:21.385
Come on, kill me! I'm here!

630
01:38:21.885 --> 01:38:25.390
Come on, do it now! Kill me!

631
01:39:45.936 --> 01:39:47.439
What the hell are you?

632
01:39:51.942 --> 01:39:57.449
What the hell are you?

633
01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:04.441
OK!

634
01:41:04.941 --> 01:41:05.442
Did you get it?

635
01:41:10.947 --> 01:41:12.449
What the ...

636
01:41:16.912 --> 01:41:19.412
My God!
